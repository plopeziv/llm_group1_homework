# 8th Light AI Cohort - Group 1 Homework Assignments

This repository contains homework assignments for Group 1 in the first AI cohort at 8th Light. Each assignment is crafted with guidance from OpenAI’s ChatGPT and runs as a standalone project.

The `assignment.py` files are Flask projects that can be executed directly from the command line using:

    python {filename}

Additionally, the `mapper.py` script assists in developing embedding functions for these projects.

## Prerequisites

To run these assignments, ensure the following libraries are installed:
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **LAPACK**: This library enables complex linear algebra computations and is essential for `mapper.py`. You can install it using Homebrew:

      brew install lapack

**Note**: LAPACK is a large package. Please review the LAPACK documentation (http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) to ensure it’s compatible with your system requirements.
