150334,NCT02827617,2024-12-31,ESTIMATED,The general aim of the project is the identification of dynamic molecular markers that can help the early and real time prediction of sustained benefit or no benefit from ibrutinib treatment in CLL harboring TP53 mutations. Specific aims of the project include: 1) Assess whether clearance of TP53 mutated clones translates into a predictive biomarker of long term benefit from ibrutinib treatment in CLL. 2) Assess whether plasma cell free DNA represents a sensitive tool that can early and dynamically inform on the development of ibrutinib resistant mutations in CLL.,"In the chemoimmunotherapy era, TP53 mutations defined a subgroup of high risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients in whom allogeneic stem cell transplantation had to be strongly considered. As a result of the accumulating favorable outcome data reported for new biological drugs, including ibrutinib, in high risk CLL harboring TP53 mutations, there is concern about whether these patients should continue to be offered allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Despite their improved outcome, a proportion of high risk CLL harboring TP53 mutations is going to develop ibrutinib resistance, which in turns translate in a very poor survival. On these bases, in the setting of ibrutinib treatment, novel biomarkers are required to re-define high risk CLL patients candidate for consolidation strategies including allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Our working hypotheses are that: i) clearance of high risk TP53 mutated clones upon treatment with ibrutinib may associate with long progression free survival (PFS), while conversely, the persistence or increase of high risk TP53 mutated subclones under ibrutinib may associate with acquisition of resistance and disease progression; and ii) plasma cell free DNA represents an accessible source of tumor DNA for the early and sensitive identification of mutations causing resistance to ibrutinib. By using highly sensitive ultra-deep next generation sequencing strategies to monitor molecular biomarkers potentially relevant for ibrutinib in DNA coming from both cellular and the plasma fractions of peripheral blood, the project has the chance of identifying new dynamic molecular markers that can help the early and real time prediction of sustained benefit from ibrutinib treatment vs imminent progression in TP53 mutated CLL patients. In the end, the results of this study will provide the bases to refine the current approach for treatment tailoring in TP53 mutated patients by allowing the identification of cases who, though being in clinical response under ibrutinib, will conceivably benefit from immediate switch to alternative options (i.e. novel drugs, allogeneic stem cell transplantation, or CART).",['Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia'],OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Patients randomized into the Control Group were implanted with a dual chamber pacemaker (DDDR) device (St. Jude Medical) standard therapy. Patients randomized into the Echo-guided Group were implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) device (St. Jude Medical), which was programmed to DDDR pacing mode (CRT-P OFF) at implant. For each Echo-guided Group patient, presence of RVA pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony was assessed within 24-hour of implant using the standardized criteria of Doppler echocardiography. The Echocardiography Core Laboratory (Echo Core Lab) then analyzed each image and the treatment allocation of the Echo-guided Group was done within 72-hour post implant based on the Echo Core Lab outcomes:

214610,NCT00744393,2009-12,ESTIMATED,"The purpose of this study is to determine what effect sodium oxybate has on the functions of sleep in mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit.","Sleep is disrupted in the critically ill and may lead to impaired neurocognitive function, decreased immune function, increased protein catabolism, and may compromise the ability to wean patients from mechanical ventilation. Critically ill patients may appear to sleep throughout most of their stay, but their quality of sleep is different from that of a normal healthy subject.Critically ill patients spend more time in the wakefulness stages of sleep (Stage 1 and 2) at the expense of the restorative stages (Stage 3 and 4) and REM sleep. These patients also experience an increased number of arousals and awakenings. Various factors are thought to be the cause of abnormal sleep architecture: ICU environment, pain, illness severity, psychosocial stress, medications, and mechanical ventilation.

Sodium oxybate (Xyrem®) is the sodium salt of the central nervous system depressant γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and is currently approved for use in narcoleptic patients to improve cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.

Studies evaluating the use of sodium oxybate in narcoleptic patients suggest that sodium oxybate is effective at increasing slow-wave sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and REM-sleep efficiency, while also decreasing REM-sleep latency, stage 1 NREM sleep and sleep fragmentation.3, 16-19 Currently there is a lack of data evaluating the effects of sodium oxybate on sleep in critically ill patients. Obtaining evidence that sodium oxybate improves sleep architecture in the critically ill, may provide the foundation to complete future studies evaluating the effect of sodium oxybate on clinical outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay. Based on sodium oxybate's ability to improve sleep architecture in narcoleptic patients along with the fact that critically ill patients have similar disrupted sleep architecture, it's postulated that sodium oxybate may improve the sleep architecture in critically ill patients.",['Mechanically Ventilated ICU Patients'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

268564,NCT03442803,2018-12-31,ESTIMATED,"There exists continued controversy over the use of propofol in Emergency Department procedural sedation, this is despite its widespread existence in clinical practice for at least a decade. These concerns are not limited to the ED setting and are primarily related to the pharmacological properties of the drug itself and its potential for harm. The bolus administration of propofol, aimed at a target of sedation, offers several advantages over more traditional agents, yet these advantages are also its limitations. The use of a target-controlled infusion may provide the sedationist with greater control over the pharmacokinetics of propofol and thus reduce the rate of adverse incidents.

This feasibility study aims to use a pragmatic design to test the safety and efficacy of propofol TCI whilst assessing the practicalities of it's use in the ED. If it proves to be feasible then the researchers plan to proceed to a multi centre pilot study to gather information to adequately power a larger randomised multi centre trial.","Procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) has long been a core skill of the Emergency Physician, although over the last decade, developments in patient monitoring and the use of newer sedative and analgesic agents have served to improve both safety and efficacy. Despite these advances and their consolidation into well-designed guidelines concern regarding the safety of ED PSA persists.

More specifically, concerns have been raised regarding the use of propofol, an ultra-short acting anaesthetic agent. The practice of using sub-anaesthetic doses of propofol to achieve sedation in ED PSA originated around the turn of the millennium and has since become the most common choice of sedative in the ED. Propofol offers a number of advantages as a sedative agent, including; a short onset and recovery time, amnesiac properties and good efficacy. The cost of these properties is in part, a narrow therapeutic range.

When given as a bolus, propofol will induce a spectrum of states up to and including general anaesthesia, dependent on the dosage. The correlation between dose and effect varies based on several patient factors. Whilst targeting a state of sedation it is possible for the operator to 'overshoot' moving rapidly from Conscious Sedation to Deep Sedation to General Anaesthesia. The inadvertent induction of general anesthesia may result in unanticipated complication.

The principle complications associated with accidental over-sedation or general anesthesia relate to the patency of the patient's airway. The reported frequency of airway complications during ED PSA with propofol range from 5.0% to 9.4%7, this includes a rate of supplemental ventilation of between 3.0% and 9.4%, with oxygen desaturation occurring in between 5% and 7% of cases12. In addition, the bolus administration of propofol may result in transient hypotension. Despite being a relatively short lived effect, this may be pronounced in those with intravascular volume depletion or in the elderly, and in some may be profound, with one series demonstrating that 3.5% of those undergoing PSA with propofol experience ≥ 20% falls in blood pressure. At first inspection the reported rate of complication may appear low, and has by some been interpreted as evidence of the relative safety of ED PSA, however alternative views have been expressed in the context of much lower rates of adverse events seen in elective painful procedures requiring conscious sedation. This is compounded by the non-standard way in which adverse events have been reported across studies.

A potential solution to the adverse events experienced with the bolus administration of propofol is the use of a target-controlled infusion (TCI). This method is widely used in anaesthetic practice and whilst the PK remains the same irrespective of if you give a bolus or infusion of propofol, TCI allows the titration in perhaps a more controlled manner.

The aim when administering propofol, as with any drug, is to induce a desired clinical effect, in this context a level of sedation. As previously alluded to, when administering propofol in a bolus fashion or as a fixed rate infusion, without regard to those factors which cause biologic variability (e.g. age, gender, weight), it is difficult to accurately and consistently predict clinical effect. The development, in the early 1990's, of computer assisted infusion devices, for the first time, allowed the clinician to target a plasma concentration, with the pump automatically altering the rate of infusion based on a pre-programmed pharmacokinetic model. These target-controlled infusion (TCI) devices have undergone significant development and are now in widespread clinical use. Their operation uses a mathematical mode that reflects a theoretical 'three-compartment' model that may comprise the central compartment (plasma), and two peripheral compartments (highly perfused tissue e.g. brain and poorly perfused tissue e.g. adipose). In a state of equilibrium, propofol will diffuse between compartments at a constant rate. These rate constants have been used in pharmacokinetic models to mathematically predict the plasma concentration and latterly the effect site concentration, in this case that in the brain.

In practical terms, TCI allows the operator to more accurately target a specific clinical effect. When propofol is administered as a bolus, the operator is likely to either under-dose, delivering an insufficient effect site concentration, or over-dose, exceeding the desired effect site concentration. TCI allows the operator to titrate to effect and then to maintain a steady state, potentially eliminating the risk of 'over shooting' and reducing the rate of adverse events. TCI is not without limitation. PK models are an estimate as they have been derived from a healthy population but any inherent inaccuracy is consistent in different populations and accounted for by careful titration.

The use of propofol TCI has been studied in a number of settings, including gastrointestinal endoscopy, dental surgery, oocyte retrieval and bronchoscopy. To our knowledge propofol TCI in sedation has not been studied in an ED setting. Trials have demonstrated a good safety profile for propofol TCI, with at least one large randomised-controlled trial in an endoscopy setting, showing a reduction in both respiratory and cardiovascular adverse events in comparison to the bolus administration of propofol. Unfortunately, trials to date have suffered from a high degree of heterogeneity, leading the Cochrane review, on the subject of propofol TCI versus manually controlled infusion in both general anaesthesia and sedation, to conclude that there was insufficient evidence to make firm recommendations regarding its use in clinical practice.",['Shoulder Dislocation'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 consists of neural stem cells that carry a virus, which can kill cancer cells. Giving multiple doses of NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 may kill more tumor cells.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

I. Determine the recommended maximum tolerated number of cycles (MTC) of intracavitary (ICT) administered Neural Stem Cells-expressing CRAd-S-pk7 (NSCCRAd-S-pk7) for phase II testing based on dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), the overall toxicity profile, and activity in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma (HGG).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. Measure possible development of antibody and T cell responses to the neural stem cells (NSCs) and/or the oncolytic virus in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), resection cavity fluid (when possible to obtain by aspiration before administering study agent through the ICT Rickham), and blood.

II. Evaluate the intracerebral biodistribution of NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 when permission to perform a brain autopsy on a study participant is given.

III. Identify the evidence of possible NSC migration outside of the brain, the presence of viral particles, and/or both in the CSF and blood.

IV. Estimate the rates of disease response using modified Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria, progression-free survival at 6 months (PFS6months), overall survival at 9 months (OS9months), and median PFS and OS in the recurrent HGG patients, and estimate the rates of disease response, PFS6months, and OS9months for the cohort of 12 GBM patients at first or second recurrence who will be treated at the MTC.

V. Assess changes in HSPG and survivin expression in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue samples treatment.

VI. Identify possible mechanisms of immune escape by analyzing immune cell population changes in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in pre- and post-treatment tumor tissue samples.

VII. Generate a biomathematical model to describe spatial temporal changes in tumor growth that may predict the effect of NSC-CRAd-S-pk7 on tumor response based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements.

All participants will receive a cleanser, a light therapy mask, and an extra activator for the light therapy mask.","Acne and sensitive skin can be closely connected due to the reported involvement of an impaired skin barrier in both conditions, which can be further aggravated by potentially irritating topical treatments.

A patient's sensitive skin may be caused by the skincare products that they are using, the amount that they are applying (over-usage), or the concomitant effect of the different products being used, as well as by underlying medical conditions. While sensitive skin can be self-perceived and sometimes clinically apparent, as there is no agreed upon medical definition of 'sensitive skin', it is a 'diagnosis' primarily made by the patient's perception. The high incidence of this problem and potential for further irritation due to current topical treatments has left many patients in need of a sensitive skin solution for their acne.

Current at-home topical treatments for mild to moderate acne include Over-the-Counter (OTC) options, primarily with either benzoyl peroxide, or salicylic acid, as well as prescription options including retinoid-based products, however the cutaneous irritation potential of topical acne active ingredients has been reported in the literature, which is not desirable in particular for patients with sensitive skin.

Among agents approved for chronic weight management, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are associated with reductions in cardiovascular mortality, with recent FDA approval for once weekly semaglutide for this indication. This study will investigate whether semaglutide is effective in reducing body weight in overweight or obese individuals with SSDs who are on APs and do not demonstrate adequate weight loss on metformin (the first line treatment for weight loss in SSDs).","People with SSDs die early of iatrogenic cardiometabolic disease.

However, metformin is only effective in \~20% of patients. Hence, there is a need for interventions for AP-induced weight gain non-responsive to metformin.

401123,NCT02106234,2017-08,ACTUAL,"Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a side-effect of intravascular administration of iodinated contrast material. It is defined as an absolute (\>44μmol/l) or relative (\>25%) increase in serum creatinine from baseline values within 48-72 hours of iodinated contrast material administration, and usually resolves within two weeks. In some cases CIN has been associated with persistent renal failure, increased risk of dialysis, and mortality. It is not clear however, whether CIN is causally related to this increased risk or whether risk of morbidity and mortality is inherent in those at risk of CIN.

CIN itself is asymptomatic and no treatment for CIN exists. Therefore, the focus lies on its prevention. Prevention guidelines have been drawn up in most countries and been implemented in most radiological departments. In the Netherlands, currently two guidelines for the prevention of CIN coexist, issued by CBO (Centraal BegeleidingsOrgaan) and VMS (Veiligheids Management Systeem).

The prevention guidelines aim to increase patient safety by identifying patients that may be at risk of CIN (mostly patients with chronic renal insufficiency), and subsequently administering prophylactic intravenous hydration to the so identified patients, in order to prevent CIN (intravenous normal saline 4-12 hours before and 4-12 hours after exposure to iodinated contrast material).

Needless to say, the introduction of these guidelines has had a great impact on patient- and health care burden. In the Netherlands alone it is estimated that yearly 100.000 to 150.000 patients receive the prophylactic treatment, incurring a total cost of over 50 million Euro. Considering the steady yearly increase of contrast procedures and the ageing population, it is evident that, in future, these numbers shall only increase further.

The prophylactic treatment prescribed by the guidelines is based on a consensus of the opinion of experts in general agreement that the treatment is beneficial. However, the effectiveness of prophylactic hydration has never been adequately evaluated. Sufficiently large randomised trials comparing prophylactic intravenous hydration with a proper control group receiving no prophylactic treatment are not available, and baseline CIN incidences in untreated populations are unknown. Thus, it is not clear whether prophylactic hydration achieves its aim to prevent CIN.

In order to be able to take effective measures to the benefit of patient safety, it is important to distinguish between the mechanisms underlying CIN and the ensuing increased risk of morbidity and mortality: whether it be biological variation of serum creatinine, renal damage, or cholesterol embolism; whether any causality exists between these and iodinated contrast material; and whether prophylactic intravenous hydration can prevent these from occurring without incurring more risks than it removes. These, in short, are the aims of the AMACING study.","Studies evaluating the effect of various prophylactic treatments invariably focus on CIN instead of clinically relevant measures as primary outcome. CIN itself being asymptomatic, it is important to determine whether prophylactic treatment has a preventive effect on clinically relevant endpoints sometimes associated with CIN, such as dialysis and mortality. Consider for example: even if it transpires that prophylactic treatment reduces CIN incidence, it may be that intravenous hydration merely dilutes serum creatinine to such an extent that it masks CIN, having no protective effect on renal function. It has been shown that changes in volume status can influence serum creatinine levels, but a potential dilution effect of intravenous hydration has not been investigated to date.

On the other hand, it is important to realise that prophylactic intravenous hydration is not without risk. Patients may suffer mild to serious complications ranging from phlebitis to pulmonary oedema, the latter being potentially fatal. Those patients selected according to the guidelines for the risk of CIN - risk factors including poor renal function, age, diabetes and cardiac disease - are especially sensitive to complications of intravenous hydration. The risk of intravenous hydration in this population has not as yet been charted, and is not taken into account by guidelines for the prevention of CIN.

It stands to reason that a patient's pre-existing hydration status may be a determining factor for the net effect of intravenous hydration: from the same treatment dehydrated patients may enjoy benefits, whereas overhydrated patients may suffer complications. The importance of hydration status in determining the effects of prophylactic hydration, however, has not been investigated to date.

The mechanism by which prophylactic hydration may protect renal function from injury by iodinated contrast material is unclear, as the mechanism by which iodinated contrast material may induce CIN is unclear. Indeed, in patients with chronic renal insufficiency biological variation of serum creatinine in the absence of contrast material has been shown to be indistinguishable from CIN. The question has arisen in recent literature whether CIN is anything more than an asymptomatic increase in serum creatinine, lacking any prognostic negative impact, and not significantly different from that observed in controls not receiving iodinated contrast material.

Recent studies comparing patients with chronic renal deficiency receiving intravascular iodinated contrast material to those patients not receiving iodinated contrast material found no association between increase in serum creatinine (CIN) and contrast administration. Indeed, it has been suggested that renal damage after intra-arterial procedures is caused, not by contrast material, but by cholesterol embolism arising from the erosion of aortic atheromatous plaques by the catheter used in such procedures.

It is perhaps of importance to note that relatively recently, monomeric non-ionic low-osmolar iodinated contrast materials - with less toxic properties than 'traditional' contrast materials - have been introduced and are now widely used, perhaps altering the landscape of CIN.

Patient Risk Any risk incurred by participating in the AMACING study will be due to not receiving prophylactic intravenous hydration. The true risk incurred from foregoing prophylactic treatment is unknown; however, recent literature suggests that it is likely to be minimal.

The estimation of risk of CIN according to current guidelines is largely based on renal function and an eGFR threshold of \<60 ml/min/1.73 m2 in combination with other risk factors is currently applied for prophylactic hydration according to Dutch guidelines. The incidence of chronic kidney disease stage 3 (eGFR 30-60 ml/min/1,73m2) in the Netherlands is 5.3%, of which at most an estimated third will have an eGFR \<45 ml/min/1,73m2.

The European Society of Urogenital Radiology updated their CIN prevention guidelines in 2011 to indicate that intravenous prophylactic hydration is unnecessary in patients with an eGFR ≥45 ml/min/1.73m2 before intravenous contrast administration. Risk analyses revealed that intravenous contrast administration does not impose a nephrotoxic risk above an eGFR of 30ml/min/1.73m2. Indeed, zero incidence of dialysis and mortality is consistently reported after intravenous contrast administration, even in patients with severe renal insufficiency (eGFR\<30) and in absence of prophylactic treatment. Since intravenous contrast administration procedures make up more than an estimated 70% of all contrast procedures this implies that prophylactic intravenous hydration is superfluous in the majority of patients currently receiving it. This patient population is also the larger proportion of patients to be included in our randomized controlled trial - an estimated 75% - who are therefore not thought to incur any risk from participation and not receiving prophylactic intravenous hydration.

Other patients we shall include may incur some risk of CIN: some have an eGFR between 30-44 ml/min/1.73m2, and some will be administered iodinated contrast material intra-arterially. The risk of CIN for the first group does not appear to be much elevated. A pooled overview of studies involving iodinated contrast material administration without prophylactic intravenous hydration yielded a CIN incidence of 3.9%: 83% of the patients diagnosed with CIN had an eGFR of ≥45 ml/min/1.73 m2. Baseline eGFR of the other CIN cases was not published.

As for the second group, although cases of long term adverse effects such as dialysis and mortality have rarely been reported following CIN after intravenous contrast administration, they have been reported after intra-arterial contrast administration. It has been thought, therefore, that intra-arterial administration led to more nefarious effects of iodinated contrast material than intravenous administration. This too, however, has been repeatedly put to question. A recent study found no difference in the risk of CIN after intra-arterial or intravenous contrast administration when an adjustment was made for patient related risk factors. Several studies found no increased risk of CIN after intra-arterial contrast administration as compared to intravenous administration, and one report even goes against all previous literature, reporting a higher risk of morbidity and mortality after intravenous contrast administration than after intra-arterial administration. In short, it is not clear whether an increased risk of dialysis and mortality arises from contrast administration and CIN or whether it is inherent in the patient population studied (i.e. a population requiring intra-arterial contrast procedures or requiring prophylactic hydration according to CIN prevention guidelines may conceivably have such an increased inherent risk). Indeed, chronic kidney disease, the main criterion in the guidelines for increased risk of CIN, in itself increases the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease and progression to kidney failure.

Causality between an increase in serum creatinine after contrast administration (CIN) and adverse events has not been shown to exist. A recent meta-analysis by McDonald et al including a 157 140 contrast procedures showed no difference in incidences of CIN, dialysis, or death between patient groups receiving contrast material versus patients not receiving contrast material (7.2% CIN after contrast-enhanced scans versus 11.1% CIN after unenhanced scans in medium- to high-risk populations, suggesting that contrast material may not be causally related to CIN). More and more the opinion rises that, where it occurs, it is the risk inherent to specific populations that leads to higher morbidity/mortality incidence after CIN or specific administration routes, and that CIN is merely a marker for such populations instead of there being a causal relationship between CIN and morbidity/mortality, or even a causal relationship between all diagnosed CIN and intravascular contrast material administration.

On the other hand there is no evidence that prophylactic intravenous hydration has a protective effect on renal function. Almost all studies evaluating prophylactic intravenous hydration to date are uncontrolled trials or retrospective cohort analyses, often involving experimental additions to the standard administration of saline prescribed in the guidelines, and thus no conclusions on its effectiveness can be drawn.

In a recent Dutch study on CIN, 35 of 454 patients at risk of CIN according to current guidelines did not receive prophylactic intravenous hydration (for reasons unexplained); yet the incidence of CIN in this subgroup was not significantly higher than that found in the population having received prophylactic treatment (1/35 or 2.9%, versus 10/419 or 2.4%). Furthermore, in studies including patients receiving contrast material without prophylactic intravenous hydration (up to 94% of the patients did not undergo prophylactic intravenous hydration in some of these studies), and having severely diminished renal function (up to 49.3% of patients), low CIN incidences were seen (range: 1.3% - 5.2%; pooled incidence 3.6%), and zero long term adverse effects were reported.

Another issue is that prophylactic intravenous hydration is not without risk. Complications may occur, especially in those patients with cardiac and/or kidney disease, such as pulmonary oedema and/or cardiac failure which could lead to respiratory insufficiency. There is a considerable overlap between patients considered to be at risk of developing CIN and patients with at risk of complications from prophylactic intravenous hydration, and therefore this is a real concern in clinical practice. A study performed in a Dutch hospital using Dutch CIN prevention guidelines reported an incidence of serious complications of intravenous hydration of 1.4% in hydrated patients. The incidence of clinically relevant events after CIN is \<1% when monomeric non-ionic low-osmolar iodinated contrast material is used, thus putting the appropriateness of the prophylactic treatment to question, and highlighting the importance of its evaluation against a proper control group not receiving intravenous hydration.

The AMACING study will be pivotal in deciding the future role of prophylactic intravenous hydration in routine clinical practice. Considering the potential benefits of the results of this study to a large population - who are perhaps burdened with unnecessary and sometimes harmful treatments - and the potential benefits to our health care system in terms of efficiency and costs, we believe the risk for all patients included in this RCT is acceptable. The incidence of CIN is low, CIN itself has no direct relevant clinical implications, and prophylactic intravenous hydration may have negative effects largely disregarded until now. Based on current evidence, therefore, we see no ethical barriers to performing the RCT in our study population. Importantly, we will not include patients that have an eGFR of \< 30 ml/min/1.73m2 even though in all probability even these patients will not be at greater risk without intravenous hydration, and we will include only those procedures involving non-ionic low osmolality monomer contrast material.","['Contrast Induced Nephropathy', 'Acute Kidney Injury']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion criteria

To assess the feasibility of conducting the Exercise-Nutrition Program in a senior housing facility setting.","Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the population in many countries around the world, and the maintenance of independence has emerged as a major public health priority. Although a significant decline in physical function was once considered an inevitable consequence of aging, many studies have demonstrated that targeted exercise programs can dramatically improve physical function, even into advanced age. There is also evidence that appropriately timed protein intake is important for exercise recovery and the growth and maintenance of lean body mass. Other nutrients may be important to muscle strength and function as well. Yet many older adults have poor nutritional status. A combined exercise and nutrition program for functionally at-risk older adults, conveniently offered in the senior housing facilities where many reside, has great potential to improve functional status and quality of life in this population.

This can be used for the reporting of upper limb musculoskeletal disorders including hand, shoulder and arm pathologies, carpel tunnel syndrome, osteoarthritis etc.","Upper limb functional disorders are quite common among Pakistani population due to high demands of work either manual or using technologies, so these disorders are also of great matter of interest. Therefore, for evaluations, diagnosis and for better treatment, a subjective questionnaire is required and hence, ULFI is a commonly used outcome measure for upper limb.

It has been previously translated into many languages i.e. in native languages of respective countries for better understanding.

Upper limb functional index (ULFI) is originally in English language and much of the Pakistani population is Urdu speaking. That is why it is required to translate the ULFI questionnaire in Urdu language.

Translation guidelines from Beaton and colleagues followed. The patients with upper limb musculoskeletal disorders will be recruited.

Data collection procedure started after the approval from institution review board committee with reference no. IRB-UOL-FAHS/882/2021. Data were collected from the patients after taking consent from them. Data collected on their first visit and second reading taken after 1 week, after that treatment will be given.

Data Analysis:

Reliability:

The ULFI-Urdu will be applied two times by a physiotherapist to determine test-retest reliability. On the first day of assessment the physiotherapist will collect demographic data and patients will answer ULFI-Urdu. For intra-rater reliability, ULFI-Urdu will be reapplied 48 hours later. Between two assessments, no treatment will be provided to minimize clinical differences. The first visit of the patient will be comprised of complete assessment along with the completion of outcome measures and upon his/her second visit the patient outcome measures will be completed before giving any treatment.

Validity:

Construct validity will be assessed by determining pearson correlation between ULFI-Urdu and DASH, ULFI-Ur and SF-12 Ur questionnaire.

Statistical Analysis:

The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy will be used to assess for factor analysis and the Barlett test of sphericity, to ensure sampling adequacy. Reliability will be assessed with Cronbach alpha, split half test and test-retest method. Floor and ceiling effects will be determined by calculating the rate of participants that obtained the lowest (0) or highest (80) scores and will be considered present if more than 15 % of the participants achieved the highest or lowest score. Validity will be assessed by explanatory factorial analysis of the ULFI scores obtained at the first meeting. Principal components analysis will be performed with varimax rotation if it will be necessary. The number of potential factors will be suggested by scree plot, Eugen value cut-off \>1.0, and 10 % variance.

332546,NCT00472862,2010-04,ACTUAL,"The study examines the effect of cognitive training on cognitive functioning and everyday competencies of patients with schizophrenia.

120 patients are expected to be included in this randomized controlled trial running at two sites in Denmark starting January 2007 The effect of a 16-week, manualized program of cognitive training integrated in a comprehensive psychosocial treatment (OPUS) for first-episode schizophrenia patients is compared with the effect of standard treatment (OPUS). A six month follow-up assessment is conducted to investigate a possible long-term learning effect of cognitive training.

Blinded assessments include the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery and a co-primary outcome measure of cognitive improvement: A translated version of the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment (UPSA) adjusted to a Danish context.

The cognitive training consists of four modules focusing on the domain of attention, executive functioning, learning and memory. Module 1 and 2 are based on computer-assisted training tasks, and the following modules focus on more practical everyday tasks and calendar training. Cognitive training takes place twice a week and every other week the patient and trainer engage in a dialogue on the patient's cognitive difficulties, motivational goals and his/her progress in competence level.

The use of errorless learning principles, scaffolding and attentional externalisation aims at improving the patients' performance on cognitive and everyday tasks by learning to apply compensation techniques as well as limiting dysfunctional uses of available cognitive ressources (i.e. excessive self-focus, rumination).

The study will provide MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery results from a relatively large Danish sample of first-episode schizophrenia and contribute with valuable normative data on the UPSA.

It is hypothesized that cognitive training integrated in OPUS treatment enhances both cognitive and everyday competence of patients more than OPUS treatment alone. Expectations are that cognitive training will demonstrate a small to moderate effect on cognitive functioning and a moderate effect on everyday functioning as measured with the UPSA. Moreover, patients allocated to cognitive training are expected to show an improvement in self-esteem.","Neurocognition and competence in schizophrenia A randomized controlled trial of cognitive training (CT) integrated in OPUS treatment versus OPUS treatment-as-usual

The presence of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia It is a well-established fact that cognitive deficits play a major role in functional outcome in schizophrenia (Keefe et al, 2006; Gold, 2004). Up to 85 % patients demonstrate cognitive dysfunctions in the range of 1½-2 SD below norm (Fagerlund, 2004; Corrigan \& Penn, 2001; Heinrichs \& Zankanis, 1998). Cognitive dysfunctions associated with schizophrenia involve attention, information processing, memory, and executive functions leading to difficulties in learning and poor problem solving abilities.

Evidence for the effect of rehabilitation on everyday competencies In spite of the severely debilitating cognitive dysfunctions, a relatively large number of patients have shown themselves capable of acquiring new abilities (e.g. Kern et al, 2005; Sartory et al, 2005; Ueland \& Rund, 2004; Krabbendam \& Aleman, 2003, Pilling et al, 2002, Harvey \& Sharma, 2001; Tsang \& Pearson, 2001, Danion et al, 2001, Bell et al, 2003, Wykes et al, 1999, 2003). Research has shown that training in symptom handling, social proficiency training, and supportive provisions in occupational relations apparently can help patients with schizophrenia to function in their daily lives, learn solving concrete practical and social tasks, and manage relatively independently. These improvements enhance self-esteem.

Effect studies of cognitive rehabilitation A Cochrane review done by Hayes \& McGrath (2000) include three small randomized controlled trials and fails to provide conclusive data on evidence for or against cognitive training as a treatment for schizophrenia.

Krabbendam \& Aleman's review (2003) of 12 controlled studies finds a weighted mean effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.45 with 95% CI, 0.26-0.64), which indicates a small to moderate effect of cognitive training (CT) for patients with schizophrenia.

In Twamley et al.'s review (2003) of 17 randomised, controlled studies of CT, a weighted mean effect size was calculated across studies. The weighted mean effect sizes (Cohen's d) were 0.32 in improvement in cognitive performance, 0.26 in reduction of symptom severity, and 0.51 in the domain of everyday functioning. The review authors recommend longitudinal designs as well as the inclusion of real-life outcome measures in future trials.

Many studies of CT have been underpowered (small sample sizes), which limits the conclusions that can be drawn from results of improvement (Ueland \& Rund, 2005). The variability of outcome measures used also complicates interpretation of findings, thus, a consensus battery (MATRICS ) of outcome measures has been suggested for future studies. Silverstein \& Wilkniss (2004) and Bellack (2004) note that the results of cognitive rehabilitation generally fail to secure the ecological validity, wherefore CT ought to be integrated in a broader psychosocial programme of intervention for schizophrenia. Other shortcomings in earlier studies include short-term programmes lacking sufficient long-sighted follow-up examinations as well as experimental designs lacking consideration of individual abilities and involvement. A recent review of cognitive rehabilitation (Velligan et al, 2006) underscores the importance of addressing motivation as a primary target.

Hogarty et al's (2004) promising results from a randomised, controlled trial (N=121) of computer-assisted CT also highlight the importance of examining to what extent the control condition (psychosocial treatment) improve cognitive functioning. Broadly viewed, there is sufficient evidence that the combination of CT and psychosocial treatment, rather than individually appearing initiatives, have the greatest potential for promoting treatment outcome (Bell et al, 2003).

There is a need for a well-organised and sufficiently large randomised clinical trial of the effect of integrated CT and psychosocial rehabilitation. In order to examine to what extent CT improves the psychosocial rehabilitation and facilitates new learning, one must identify and compare improvements on the level of neuropsychological performance as well as the level of everyday competencies (Reeder et al, 2006; Buchanan et al, 2005; McKibbin et al, 2004). The present trial employs a prospective design of 16 weeks with a following follow-up 10 months after inclusion, and seeks in the CT to secure an individual adaptation and motivation trough continuous evaluations and level adjustments between patient and trainer.

Objectives

1. Primary hypothesis The effect of a 16-weeks programme of computer-based CT integrated in OPUS treatment on the patients' competencies in daily life is superior to standard OPUS treatment. Primary response variable: Total score on UPSA-B (Patterson et al, 2001 Danish version).
2. Secondary hypothesis The effect of a 16-weeks programme CT integrated in OPUS treatment on patients' cognitive functioning is superior to standard OPUS treatment. Response variables: Scores on MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), Trailmaking B and WCST-64 (computerized version).
3. Tertiary hypothesis The effect of a 16-weeks programme of computer-based CT integrated in OPUS treatment is superior to standard OPUS treatment in terms of patients' association with the labour market, general health and self-esteem. Response variables: Occupational status and general functioning measures and Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale (Rosenberg, 1989).

Furthermore, we want to examine the association between first episode patients' cognitive function level and competencies in daily life, can be divided in primary and secondary objectives:

Blinding The instructor for CT will make a call with participants' data to CTU and thereafter inform the patients which intervention programme he or she has been allocated to. The study is not blinded in regard to patients, cognitive trainers and therapists. The blinding applies raters engaged with the outcome evaluation. In the follow-up the patient is instructed in advance not to reveal what type of treatment they have received. By registering which type of intervention the independent assessors of outcome believe the patient to be receiving it will be evaluated if blinding succeeded. The randomised intervention allocation is concealed until the statistical analyses of resulting data have been completed.

Participants Patients are recruited from OPUS which is implemented as a standard treatment programme for young adults with firstepisode psychosis in Copenhagen and Århus. The staff in OPUS recruit patients to the project. The independent assessors interview referred patients and evaluate the following in- and exclusion criteria.

Inclusion criteria 1) between 18 and 35 years of age, 2) first episode psychosis within F2 spectrum or schizotypal disorder in ICD 10 - post-acute phase of illness, 3) sufficient comprehension of Danish, 4) written informed consent.

Exclusion criteria

1) rejection of participation, 2) organic disorder, 3) noticeable misuse of psychoactive drugs

Control intervention group All patients receive the treatment usually provided in OPUS.

Standard treatment in OPUS consists of affiliation with a primary contact person, involvement of family, possibility of psychoeducation and social skills training described in details at http://www.psykiatri.aaa.dk/cent_enh/opus.htm and www.opus-kbh.dk. Depending on individual needs patients are offered to take part in group therapy either social skills training (SST) or cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). Participation in SST or CBT might be beneficial for both cognition and everyday skills. To ensure comparability between the patients allocated to experimental intervention (CT) and the patients allocated to standard OPUS treatment, we stratify patients according to group therapy (SST/CBT) yes/no.

Patients randomized to the control group will receive treatment as usual as described above.

Experimental intervention A pilot study in OPUS Århus has led to the completion of a manual for a 16-week CT programme for patients with schizophrenia (Christensen \& Olsen, 2006).

One hour twice a week in 16 weeks patients engage in computer-assisted CT plus one competence dialog every other week. Training consists of four modules: the first three modules cover the areas of attention, memory and executive functions, and the last module focus on the cognitive area and related tasks that the individual patient need or prefer to work more on: Thus, the content of module 4 is based on both the patient's and the trainer's judgement.

Training contains exercises of simple attention, attention span and vigilance, planning, problem solving, stimulus-bind and perseveration tendency, interaction-based training of working memory, and verbal and visual long-term memory. The CT approach is oriented towards teaching of compensatory strategies, but simple repetition of non-social cognitive tasks on a gradually increasing level of difficulty is also part of the CT program. By 90 % correct task-completion, the level is increased.

Module 1 and 2 are based on computertasks (COGNIsoft), whereas the following modules 3 and 4 include practical everyday tasks. In their review Twamley, Jeste and Bellack (2003) stress the importance of directly targeting everyday functioning of the patient. Thus, calendartraining is a vital part of this intervention: a way of addressing common difficulties of memory and planning ability. Calendartraining and competence dialogues both support environmental adaptation and transference of learning.

Training relies on errorless learning principles, scaffolding, repetition, and strategy-learning as recommended by Wykes \& van der Gaag (1999). Positive reinforcement, modelling, and verbal instructions are widely used. Trainers describe the structure and explain the purpose of training exercises at the beginning of every session to provide a consistent learning environment.

Assessments All assessments except Present State Examination-interview (PSE, clinical version) and premorbid IQ (DART: Danish version of National Adult Reading Test, Nelson, 1991) are conducted at baseline, 4 months and 10 months after inclusion, irrespective of whether patients were following the full training programme (intention-to-treat principle).

Antioxidants content in Curcuma is hypothesized to alleviate the free radicals. This study aimed to examine the effect of Curcuma extract in the form of ice cream to improve muscle damage and inflammation of soccer athletes caused by strenuous exercise. This study was experimental study with pre-post control group design. Male soccer athlete (n=20) were divided into treatment group (n=10) and control group (n=10). The treatment group was treated by Curcuma extract ice cream for 21 days. Blood samples of creatine kinase (as muscle damage marker) and IL-6 (as inflammation marker) were quantified.,"Muscle damage is a clinical problem caused by the adaptation process in strenuous exercise of soccer athletes which free radical is the main culprit of the damage. There is a significant increment of muscle damage after strength exercise using leg press. Physical exercise leads to inflammation process in endothelial cells of blood vessel which can be marked by releasing cytokine. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of cytokine pro-inflammation and this marker is used as an indicator for inflammation of micro-trauma in muscle during strenuous exercise.

Normally, free radical generation will be stabilized by endogenous antioxidant secretion such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and catalase; nevertheless, body needs exogenous antioxidant to support endogenous antioxidant as a scavenger of free radical in such condition.

Muscle damage due to the strenuous exercise should be managed to avoid the pain feeling and subsequently decrease athlete performances. Some previous studies used herbs such as ginger (Zingiber officinale), ginseng (Panax quinquefolium), and Curcuma to relieve the muscle damage and inflammation resulting from high-intensity exercise.The Curcuma extract treatment to the athlete gained lack of success; therefore, supplementation to food products might use to increase acceptability. Ice cream is one of the products, which has a broad segment market and every single person regardless of age is fond of it.

Curcumin is an antioxidant substance contained in Curcuma and it has better antioxidant capacity compared to the other component in Curcuma such as demetoksicurcumin and bisdemetoksicurcumin.Besides, curcumin has an efficient reaction with superoxide radicals as well as lipid antioxidants has, and the reaction leads to superoxide catalytic degradation in which curcumin represents as a superoxide dismutase.

With the obtained results it was possible the development of a phytopharmaceutical elaborated with the extract of this plant, which was standardized in its content of Galphimine-B (G-B). This new compound is a nor, seco-triterpene, which possesses selective effects on the central nervous system. Through electrophysiological neuronal unitary records it was identified that G-B acts on the ventral tegmental area (VTA), and exerts its effect on (N-methyl-D-aspartate) NMDA receptors in dopaminergic neurons. The new phytopharmaceutical, elaborated from a standardized extract (in its G-B content) of G. glauca, was subjected to a double blind and randomized clinical study that compared its efficacy and therapeutic tolerability with a similar drug formulated with lorazepam in patients with diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). In a total of 152 patients, it was evidenced that the phytomedicine administered orally (for 4 weeks) was able to significantly reduce anxiety, in a similar way as lorazepam did, but with better tolerability. Several patients who were treated with lorazepam had to leave the study because they had daytime sleepiness.

In clinical practice, different benzodiazepines have specific indications. In the case of anxiety disorders, the drug of first choice is Alprazolam, this, because it manifests a more powerful anxiolytic effect with a lower degree of sedation and daytime sleepiness.

Objective: The present project aims to compare the efficacy and therapeutic safety of an elaborated phytopharmaceutical with the standardized extract of Galphimia glauca with Alprazolam .","A double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical study will be conducted in patients with GAD.

The development of the phytopharmaceutical will be carried out at the Southern Biomedical Research Center, belonging to the Mexican Institute of Social Security. The preparation of the plant material, extraction, concentration, standardization of the vegetable drug, the design and production of the experimental drug as well as the control treatment will be carried out in this site.

The clinical trial will be developed with outpatient from the Primary Care Family Medicine Unit of the Regional General Hospital No. 1 of the Mexican Institute of Social Security in Cuernavaca, Morelos, Mexico.

SUBJECTS. Patients of both sexes aged 18 years and older who present Generalized Anxiety disorder (GAD) and who meet the selection criteria.

Experimental group Patients with a clinical diagnosis of GAD (with a score of 18 points or more on the Hamilton anxiety scale) that will be included in the experimental group and will be assigned the treatment consisting of hard gelatin capsules with a pharmaceutical formulation prepared with a standardized extract (in its content of Galphimine-B, G-B) of G. glauca, which will be administered once a day.

Control group Patients with a clinical diagnosis of GAD (with a score of 18 points or more on the Hamilton anxiety scale) that will be included in the control group and will be assigned the treatment consisting of hard gelatin capsules with the drug Alprazolam (1 mg ), which will be administered once a day.

GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY The project will be promoted through posters that will be placed in strategic areas of the Medical Unit. In addition, brochures will be distributed with information about anxiety and the requirements to enter the project. There will also be support staff, Who will be in charge of giving conferences related with GAD in the waiting Hospital rooms. Once a person is identified who is a candidate to be included in the study, an invitation will be made to go to the clinical research office for evaluation.

In the research office, a trained physician, will practice the candidates a medical history and physical examination. The above, with the purpose of corroborating the diagnosis of GAD through the application of the Hamilton Anxiety Scale. This fully validated instrument will serve to make the clinical diagnosis of the condition.

If the questionnaire applied to the candidate gives us a total score of 18 points or more, the patient will be considered a candidate to enter the study. In order to be admitted, the patient, in addition must to have a clinical diagnosis of GAD, must meet the selection criteria established in this study. Once the patient complies with these two aspects will be given the necessary information about the study and about their participation in it. Patient must also sign a letter of informed consent, this letter will contain information about the characteristics of the study, benefits to the population, commitment that the patient acquires when participating, commitments that the researcher acquires when the patient is included and the rights that the participant acquires.

Each of the participants will be randomly assigned the corresponding medication (which can be experimental or control) through a procedure based on a table of random numbers. The dosage of medications will be every 24 hours, administered orally in the morning. The indication will be given that the medication is taken together with the food. The duration of the administration of the medication will be for ten weeks.

In addition, each of the patients will be provided oral and written instructions on the form and times to take the medication, as well as the possible adverse effects and hygienic-dietetic measures that must be taken.

The patient will be following weekly, but may go to receive care at the time you require it. At each appointment, the state of health and the evolution of the condition will be evaluated, and the overall improvement scale will also be applied. At each appointment, patient will be given a control card (to each patient) where he will write down the days the medication was taken and whether or not there were any adverse effects during that administration period. In this way, adherence to treatment and tolerability will be evaluated.

The values of the Hamilton anxiety scale and the global improvement scale will be used to define the effectiveness, the therapeutic success or failure.

The final assessment of efficacy, tolerability, attachment and therapeutic success will be made during the last appointment. A summary will be sent to the family doctor of each of the participants and their discharge from the study.

SAMPLE SIZE The size of the sample was calculated according to the formula for comparison of two proportions, taking as background the efficacy that the species showed in previous clinical studies on generalized anxiety. The procedure yielded a total of 105 patients. 15% will be added to the sample size to compensate for possible losses, which leaves us with a final sample size of 122 patients.

DATA ANALYSIS. The results will be analyzed through descriptive statistics with frequencies and percentages. The X2 test will be used for the analysis of differences in proportions and ANOVA for mean differences, as well as Tukey's test for the difference between groups. Values of p less than 0.05 will be used to define differences between statistically significant groups

ETHICAL ASPECTS Project research was evaluated and approved by the National Scientific National Committee.

The species G. glauca has been used for many years in traditional Mexican medicine to treat some mental disorders. A pharmaceutical formulation, elaborated with the extract obtained from G. Glauca has been used in clinical projects to evaluate its efficacy and tolerability in patients with anxiety disorder. The administration time has been four weeks with a daily dose of a standardized product in 0.374 mg of G-B per dose. No significant adverse effects have been identified. Because it is a phytopharmaceutical that has shown good tolerability, the risk of adverse effects is low.

In developing this project, the aim is to have a novel alterative treatment that expresses a different mechanism of action, and that shows efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of GAD, but also that the effect obtained is comparable or better than that of a drug, elaborated with Alprazolam, which is the benzodiazepine of first choice and with specific indication for the treatment of this condition.

According to the Regulation of the General Law of Health in Research, there is no risk in the patients who will participate in the present project. The project will only include adults; will not include women with pregnancy or lactation or another sector vulnerable to research.

The research procedures are in accordance with the ethical rules of investigation, the Regulation of the General Law of Health in the field of health research and the Declaration of Helsinki and its amendments. All information obtained by conducting this study will be handled in a scientific and confidential manner. The clinical files will be kept under guard and the management of the information for the analysis of results will be done exclusively with the assigned folio number. No patient will be included if it is not widely known in which it will consist of their participation, the background of the medication, time that will last the study, dose that will be administered and frequency of the same, laboratory studies to which you will be subjected in addition to informing you that you have the freedom to withdraw from the study at the time you want. The patient will receive extensive and clear information about the protocol, the content of the letter of informed consent will be read, will be given space for the formulation of questions or concerns.

ASPECTS OF SECURITY The patients included in the study will be evaluated clinically in each of the appointments. In addition, at the beginning of the study and at the end of the administration period, laboratory tests will be performed to assess liver and kidney function. Medical surveillance with the search for adverse events will be included in each of the visits. In case of identifying any adverse effect, it will be monitored until its disappearance and the measures described below will be applied according to the event's rating.

An adverse event will be considered as any unpleasant, unintentional harmful medical occurrence that a patient submits to the administration of a pharmaceutical product, which may or may not have a causal relationship to the treatment.

The intensity of the adverse events refers to the maximum intensity with which the patient and / or the investigator qualify the adverse events that the patient presents.

1. Mild: The adverse effect is presented, but it is easily tolerated and does not require treatment
2. Moderate: the adverse effect is enough to interfere with normal activities
3. Severe: The adverse effect incapacitates the subject
4. Serious: Any adverse effect that results in the death of the patient, endangers life, requires hospitalization, causes disability or persistent or significant disability, causes a congenital anomaly or cancer, requiring surgical intervention to prevent permanent sequel or develop drug dependence or abuse Overdose is defined as the exposure without a specific therapeutic goal to an amount of medication of at least twice the maximum daily dose reported in the study protocol.

In all cases in which a severe adverse effect is identified, the treatment will be suspended and the patient will be removed from the study. In addition to the above, the patient will be referred for care in the specialized medical area and will be monitored until the resolution of the adverse effect. In the event of a serious adverse effect, the treatment will be suspended, the patient will be removed from the study and the blind code of the patient will be opened. In those cases in which there is a mild or moderate adverse effect, it will be reported in the patient's clinical file, it will be attended immediately and surveillance will be maintained until its complete remission. In these cases, the treatment will not be suspended, and the patient will remain within the investigation.",['Generalized Anxiety Disorder'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Urethral lubrication can be performed in two different techniques: instillation of the gel directly into the urethra or pouring the gel on the catheter's tip. In this study, we will evaluate the pain level during female urethral catheterization in each technique.

Our hypothesis is that the level of pain will be much less if the lubrication agent will be instilled directely to the urethra.","This is a randomized prospective study that will compare the pain levels of urethral catheterization in women randomized to intraurethral lidocaine gel instillation or lubrication of the catheter's tip with lidocaine gel.

Patients will be randomized to 2 groups: (1) 5mL of 2% lidocaine gel instilled directly into the urethra 5 minutes before catheterization; (2), 5mL of 2% lidocaine gel poured on the distal part of the catheter. The randomization technique will be employed by a computerized random number generator.

Additionally, the link between covid-19 and diabetes remains controversial.","Data from poorly controlled patients with type 1 diabetes remains controversial regarding whether diabetes itself could increases the susceptibility of infection with SARS-CoV-2 and subsequently impacts the outcomes in these patients , or the SARS-CoV-2 subsequently affects the risk of type 1 diabetes and increase in the prevalence of severe DKA.

Poorly controlled diabetes and chronic hyperglycemia creates a state of low grade chronic inflammation, which may explain the underlying mechanism of increased susceptibility to infection and infer the outcome in patients with diabetes .

Poorly controlled diabetes has been linked to multiple derangements of immune system including inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation in response to different stimuli, as well as impaired monocyte/macrophage function together with increased synthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules that mediate tissue inflammation .

Few data links the association between development of diabetic ketoacidosis in patients with COVID-19, where the infection could trigger higher stressful conditions, with the release of stress hormones leading to increased blood glucose levels and abnormal glucose variability .

164166,NCT05272436,2021-06-06,ACTUAL,"The IVR games have been enhanced to include more levels. The new aspects to be tested in this study are new IVR exercises that would be made upper limb rehab designed for children for home use, as repeated sessions with progression through different levels could improve the prospect of good functional recovery. A new wireless headset has recently become available, which will enable the IVR to be run without the need for separate equipment, thereby making home use possible as no complicated set-up will be required.

This project aims to explore the feasibility, acceptability and perceived effectiveness of an improved suite of Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) system suitable for Upper Limb Motor Impairment (ULMI) rehabilitation for children at home. A multidirectional perspective has been adopted, including patients, caregivers, and clinical staff.

The aims and objectives of the clinical feasibility trial are:

* to investigate the potential of IVR for ULMI rehabilitation (range of motion recovery) at home compared to usual physical therapy in a small sample of paediatric patients.
* to measure the impact of the interventions from a mixed methods (quantitative and qualitative) and a multidirectional perspective (patients, clinicians, family members).","This project builds upon a previous MRC 'Confidence in Concept' feasibility project which developed Virtual Reality (VR) games for participants at Sheffield Children's Hospital to do arm rehabilitation movements such that they become so engrossed in the IVR they become much less aware of any pain or discomfort linked to the exercises.

Patients (and carer where appropriate) would be involved in the design of the scenarios, the protocol, patient information sheets, and the project steering group. Research nurses will download anonymised usage data from the VR headset used at home and interview participants. All data will feed into an evaluation which will demonstrate the concept and acceptability of using IVR at home.

Procedure Patients usually have a 20-30 minutes appointment during which the OT/PT reviews their previously prescribed home exercise regime with them, measures ROM, and explains and discusses new home exercises. For the purpose of the trial, patients had their usual OT/PT appointments but were asked to use the IVR games to do the prescribed home exercises. Before consenting to participate, each patient was offered a 5-10 minute experience of the game to familiarise themselves with how it worked and to check for problems. Written and verbal consents were taken from parents and children.

The pre-trial PedsQL was administered in the initial OT/PT appointment. Children were then asked to use the IVR system for approximately 15 minutes twice a day. Trial participation lasted three weeks during the prescribed treatment weeks.

Following the at-home trial, patients and parents returned the equipment to the clinic in the final appointment and the SUS and the post-trial Peds QL were administrated by OT/PT in person. In addition, they participated in semi-structured interviews as described above.

At the end of the trial, an interview (10 minutes) with the OT was conducted by a research nurse.","['Upper Limb Injury', 'Virtual Reality', 'Rehabilitation', 'Paediatric']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

371531,NCT03584230,2017-08-26,ACTUAL,"Researchers in education have found that teachers often differ in their nonverbal behaviors toward children from different social groups and these behaviors correlate with achievement gaps and academic stereotypes about the groups. Early elementary school, when achievement gaps first emerge, is also the time when White, majority children begin to show group-level biases, and when racial minority children are able to detect discrimination and experience anxiety related to their membership in a particular social group. Therefore, if children are sensitive to teacher nonverbal behaviors, these behaviors could contribute to majority children's group biases, and may impact minority children's awareness of being in a negatively stereotyped group. In fact, children are adept at perceiving adult nonverbal behaviors and using these behaviors to guide their own behaviors and to make judgments about others. The primary goal of this research is to examine the effect of biased nonverbal teacher behaviors on group biases for children from positively stereotyped groups, and on affect and anxiety for children from negatively stereotyped groups. The investigators hypothesize that group biases in teacher behaviors will influence children's attitudes about groups, and will result in negative affect and anxiety for students in groups targeted by negative nonverbal teacher behaviors.","In the present study, the investigators test whether children attend to patterns in teachers' nonverbal behaviors toward different groups, and use group-level differences to guide their own evaluations of individuals from different groups. Although existing research has found correlations between teacher behaviors and group-level attitudes (e.g., math/gender stereotypes), it is difficult to identify the causal link between the specific teacher behaviors and children's attitudes. Additionally, with existing groups such as those defined by race or gender, there are a variety of factors that could influence children's stereotype knowledge or bias before participating in the study. Therefore, in the present research participants learned about students who were members of novel social groups (defined by t-shirt color). Additionally, because children's intergroup preferences are influenced by their own group membership, the investigators also assigned children to the novel groups. Some children were assigned to the group that subsequently received positive behaviors from the teacher ('positive group'), some children were assigned to the group that subsequently received negative behaviors from the teacher ('negative group'), and a third group of children participated in a control condition where they were also assigned to a group and received a t-shirt, but did not see any interactions between their ingroup members and the teacher ('no teacher cues').

To test whether teacher nonverbal behaviors play a causal role in children's intergroup attitudes, after assigning participants to one of the three groups, they viewed a series of interactions where students from each of two novel groups interact with a teacher, and the teacher's nonverbal behavior was correlated with group membership: across the interactions, one group always received positive teacher behaviors and the other received negative teacher behaviors. The investigators then assessed children's group-level stereotypes and preferences for new students from the positive and negative groups. Across three sets of test questions, the investigators asked participants who they thought was smarter, who they would prefer as a friend, and who they would select as a partner on an academic task.

Based on the studies of children's stereotyping, it was predicted predicted that children in all three groups would report that new students in the positive group were smarter than students in the negative group. However, when asked whom they would like to befriend, it was hypothesized that children's own group membership would influence their choices: children who were in the group that received positive behaviors or the group that did not interact with the teacher would prefer to befriend students from the positive group, but children in the group that received negative behaviors would show no preference or prefer their own group. When asked who they would prefer as a partner on an academic task, it was once again predicted that students in the positive and no cues groups would select students from the positive groups. However, there were no clear predictions for participants from the negative group; if they were more influenced by stereotypes, they would be more likely to select students from the positive group and if they were more influenced by ingroup preferences, they would be more likely to select students from the negative group.

Participants. Participants were 96 5- to 7-year-old children (32 per condition, Mmean age = 6;6, range = 4;8-8;4, 48 males, 53% Multiracial, 23% White, 21% Asian) living in Hawai'i. The investigators were able to obtain information about current school level for 91 participants; of these participants, 26% were in preschool or pre-kindergarten, 69% were in kindergarten, and 4% were in first grade. One additional child participated but was excluded for not finishing the session. There was a pre-determined a stopping rule of 32 participants per condition based on previous studies examining children's understanding of nonverbal behaviors.

Materials. At the beginning of the familiarization, participants were first presented with a picture of three groups of 12 children gender matched to the participant and representing a variety of races common in Hawaii. Each group wearing a different color shirt (orange, blue, or green). Then, they viewed four 17-second clips featuring an interaction between a female teacher and two students who matched the gender of the participant. In each video, the students wore green and orange t-shirts and the teacher wore black. The teacher and the students were unfamiliar to participants. Throughout each video, the teacher faced the students and the participant; the participant could only see the backs of the students' heads.

In each video, the teacher first faced forward, then turned toward the student on the left while that student read a brief (7 s) passage. Then, she turned and faced the student on the right while that student read the same passage. The audio clips of the students reading were the same with minor adjustments made to tone and pitch so that the voices sounded different. The teacher then faced forward at the end of the clip. Across the videos, the teacher directed positive nonverbal behaviors (i.e., smiles and nods) toward students wearing one color while they read and negative nonverbal behaviors (i.e., frowns and head shakes) toward students wearing the other color while they read.

Test trials featured photographs of children who matched the gender of the participant and varied by race to match the racial diversity of classrooms in Hawaii. On each trial, participants viewed a pair of children who were matched according to race, age, and attractiveness (based on adult ratings). In each pair of children, one wore an orange shirt and the other wore a green shirt.

Procedure. Participants were tested individually in the lab. The study was presented on a monitor and an experimenter sat facing the child during the familiarization so that she was unaware of which t-shirt group (orange or green) received positive or negative nonverbal behaviors from the teacher.

Familiarization Phase. At the start of the session, participants were told that they would be learning about a school with three groups of kids: oranges, greens and blues. They were going to pretend like they went to the school and would be in one of the groups. They then received either an orange, green, or blue t-shirt to wear during the study.

After putting on the t-shirt, they were told that they were going to watch some of the kids in the orange and green groups do some reading for their teacher. Participants then watched four familiarization videos in which the teacher directed positive behaviors toward students from one group, and directed negative behaviors toward students from the other group.

Test Phase. After viewing the familiarization videos, participants were told that the experimenter was going to ask them some questions about new kids in the orange and green groups. There were three blocks of four test trials. On smart test trials, participants were asked to select the student they thought was smarter and the investigators defined smart as ""someone who is really good at learning stuff."" On friend test trials, participants were asked who they would want to be friends with. On partner test trials, participants were asked who would pick as a partner to help them read a hard book. Participants indicated their answers by pointing and never received feedback. In between each block of test trials participants viewed one of the familiarization videos for a second time. After the three blocks of test trials, participants completed some additional measures that are not reported here.

Design. Participants were randomly assigned to the positive, negative, or no cues condition. In the positive condition, they were assigned to wear a t-shirt that was the same color as the student who received the positive nonverbal behaviors from the teacher in the familiarization videos. In the negative condition, participants were assigned to wear a t-shirt that was the same color as the student who received the negative nonverbal behaviors from the teacher in the familiarization videos. In the no cues condition, participants were assigned to wear a t-shirt that was not shown in either the familiarization videos or test trials. The t-shirt color of the positive and negative groups, the order of familiarization videos, the order of test trial blocks, the students in each test trial block, and the students in the positive and negative groups varied across participants.

Scoring. On each test trial, selecting the student who wore the same t-shirt color as the students receiving positive nonverbal behaviors from the teacher in the familiarization was scored as 1 and selecting the student who wore the same t-shirt color as the students receiving negative behaviors from the teacher in the familiarization was scored as 0. For each participant, the investigators created an average positive group score for each trial type by summing across each block and dividing by the total number of completed trials (4 in most cases, except for one participant who did not give a response on two trials, and two participants who did not give a response on one trial, one participant in the no cues condition failed to give any responses on friend trials so they were excluded from analyses of that variable).

Nonverbal Coding. To assess whether being a member of a group that received positive, negative, or no teacher behaviors influenced participants' affect and anxiety, the investigators analyzed footage of the participants during the task. The investigators first created video clips of the participants when they were viewing the teacher directing nonverbal behaviors to the students in the familiarization. For each participant, there was a total of 8 clips: four clips of the participants viewing positive interactions and four clips of participants viewing negative interactions. For participants in the positive condition, the positive interactions were ingroup interactions and the negative interactions were outgroup interactions. For participants in the negative condition, the negative interactions were ingroup interactions and the positive interactions were outgroup interactions. For participants in the no cues condition, both positive and negative interactions of interactions were outgroup interactions. The videos were then coded for the affect and anxiety of the participant on a scale of -3 to 3. For affect, negative codes corresponded to behaviors like furrowing the brows, mouth turned down, or head shaking; for anxiety, negative codes corresponded to behaviors like tense muscles, withdrawn or fidgety, or displaying self-comfort behaviors. For affect, positive codes corresponded to behaviors like relaxed or raised brows, mouth turned up, or head nodding; for anxiety, negative codes corresponded to behaviors like relaxed muscles, open expansive posture, or fluid movement. Each coder rated both kinds of codes for each clip.","['Stress, Psychological', 'Stress, Emotional']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Prior work showed informational telenovelas had a positive effect on Latino family caregivers' attitudes toward end-of-life (EOL) care services. The role of videos in hospice and palliative care shows significant promise, underscoring the videos as a mode of education for family caregivers that could potentially enhance caregiver's self-efficacy, decrease caregiver's anxiety, and reduce burnout. Despite the value of video education, many programs have failed to provide engaging material.

Based on input from HFCG, the investigators have produced a bilingual (Spanish and English version) four chapter telenovela video series (To Care/ El privilegio de cuidar) as part of NCI funded diversity supplement study. Founded upon extensive preliminary work, To Care portrays the journey of one hospice family as the family struggle with the hospice decision, pain management, decision-making, and finally the dying process. Averaging only 4:65 minutes, each chapter addresses one of these problems, validating family experiences and identifying potential solutions. Based on this work and interviews with hospice staff the investigators have built an intervention, NOVELA, to disseminate telenovelas to family caregivers in hospice agencies.

This study will replicate the intervention from a previous clinical trial conducted in the UK during the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020/21 (NCT04418362) and extend it by examining EEG activity before, during, and after the intervention, alongside outcome measures, including changes in pain intensity and severity, sleep, mood and quality of life.

Ten participants will take part in pre-intervention assessments followed by four weeks of EEG baseline readings (5 times per week for 5 minutes), eight weeks of NFB treatment (5 times per week for 40 mins), and 12 weeks of post treatment EEG baselines readings (5 times per week for 5 minutes). Participants will be provided with training and detailed instructions on how to self-administer the NFB treatment using a bespoke headset and tablet-based software application in the comfort of their own homes.

Assessments will be conducted at Week 0 (pre-intervention), Week 4 (pre-NFB treatment), Week 12 (post NFB treatment) and at follow up points (Week 16, 20, and 24). It is anticipated this study will provide evidence of the safety, efficacy, reliability and validity of a low-cost non-pharmacological solution to the physical, psychological and social difficulties experienced by individuals with chronic neuropathic pain conducted within the NHS health system.","This research trial aims to explore the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of an 8-week home-based EEG neurofeedback training programme for a sample of 10 individuals living with severe chronic neuropathic pain within the NHS treatment framework.

Neurofeedback training aims to modulate brain EEG activity arising from cortical and sub-cortical areas of the brain associated with pain perception and modulation, and preliminary findings suggest it could be a safe and effective tool in the treatment of chronic pain.

Several studies indicate that neurofeedback which aims to upregulate alpha frequency activity over sensorimotor areas of the brain can produce substantial improvements in pain. Recent systematic reviews have called for more robustly designed trials in terms of methodology and feasibility and for changes in EEG activity to be measured and correlated with outcome measure assessments.

A recent proof of concept study (Number of participants=16) was conducted in the UK during the Covid pandemic lockdown in 2020/21, to examine the safety and efficacy of a home-based EEG neurofeedback intervention for the management of chronic pain and associated symptoms. This study as referred to below, showed significant improvements in pain, central sensitisation, sleep, mood and quality of life measures for many of the heterogenous group, alongside correlations with changes in EEG activity.

Study title: Brain Train for Pain - A home-based neurofeedback intervention to treat the primary and secondary symptoms of chronic pain.

REC reference: 20/NW/0209 Protocol number: ED1001033 IRAS project ID: 277936

This trial will utilise an updated version of the equipment (Headset, tablet and software App) and replicate the neurofeedback intervention while expanding on the above study by showing changes in EEG activity during and after the intervention period in a homogenous cohort of participants living with chronic neuropathic pain. Furthermore, it will validate the efficacy of a home-based telehealth intervention for chronic neuropathic pain within the NHS.

The primary hypotheses of this study are that:

i) 8 weeks of usual care plus active EEG neurofeedback is feasible, safe, and clinically efficacious, resulting in a reduction in perceived pain, and improvement in central sensitisation, mood, sleep, and quality of life measures ii) Baseline EEG resting state activity will differ over three time points - pre, during, and post-intervention.

iii) Changes in EEG activity will be correlated with changes in primary and secondary outcome measures

The research team will conduct a simple single arm cohort study measuring outcomes before and after an 8-week period of neurofeedback intervention and then throughout a follow up period of 12 weeks. The total time period for each participant will be 23 weeks.

All potential applicants will be screening against eligibility criteria. Individuals who meet the eligibility criteria will be invited to take part in this trial.

Potential participants will be recruited from a variety of sources including East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust (EKHUFT) Out-patient clinics (primarily from the Out-patient clinic of the Chief Investigator), patient association networks (for example: Kent Multiple Sclerosis Therapy Centre and Headway Kent), NHS primary care in East Kent and social media may also be used.

Participant time-line -

Week 1 - EEG baseline measurements (5 times during the week for 5 mins) and initial outcome measurements Week 2 - Transition week - Research team video based appointment for checking all aspects and further training required and outcome measure assessment.

Weeks 3 to 10 - active self administered neurofeedback treatment by participant at home - 5 times per week for 40 minute sessions.

Weeks 11 to 23 - EEG baseline measurements (5 times per week for 5 mins). 4 video based follow up appointments with a member of the research team for outcome measurements and checking and confirmation of any potentially reported issues.

After completion of the trial, all participants will be provided with a debrief document to enable participants to have an opportunity to discuss anything they would like with the Chief Investigator and also to enable them to have the opportunity of obtaining a brief 1-page summary report of the results of the research after all data and results have been analysed.

Statistical Analysis.

Study results will first undergo descriptive level statistical analyses. Continuous variables will be reported using mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range), depending on the data distribution, and dichotomous and categorical variables will be reported using frequencies (proportion). All data will be analysed following intention-to-treat principles. Secondary per protocol analyses may also be completed. The difference in primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed with linear or general linear mixed effects models, controlling for baseline scores. The research team will report the number of participants with missing scores for each outcome and any imputations will be carried out consistent with the approaches laid out in Gelman and Hill (Ref: Gelman A. and J. Hill, Missing-data Imputation in Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical models. 2006, London, UK. p. 529-544.)

Hypertension is a major modifiable risk factor for CVD and approximately 60% of adults in the US are pre-hypertensive and hypertensive. In addition, the prevalence of hypertension is associated with aging in both genders; however, the increase in blood pressure (BP) in women after menopause exceeds that of men.

The development of effective and safe strategies to improve vascular function is of significance as it can have a great impact on quality of life, productivity and economic burden for the affected populations. One such alternative would be to introduce into the diet food sources that are rich in naturally occurring bioactive compounds.

318395,NCT00943540,2011-01,ACTUAL,"The licensed dose of raltegravir is 400 mg twice daily with or without food. Raltegravir is metabolized predominantly through glucuronidation by UGT1A1. Atazanavir increases the plasma concentrations of raltegravir 400 mg twice daily by 72% due to inhibition of UGT 1A1.

This suggests that combined use of atazanavir and a lower dose frequency of raltegravir, once daily for example, is possible. Another reason why raltegravir most likely can be applied is that its pharmacodynamic effect is not related to Cmin but to AUC which is expected to be similar for an 800mg QD dose when compared to 400mg BD. Phase III clinical trials evaluating QD dosing of raltegravir are currently ongoing and interim results are expected to be published in mid 2009.

Subjects and Methods: Women with normal AF index and gestational age between the 33 and 36 weeks without maternal complications were randomized into three groups (isotonic solution, water, control). The isotonic solution and water groups were instructed to drink 1.5L of respective solution; the control group was instructed to drink 200mL of water. AF index was measured before and after hydration. The investigator performing the AF index was blinded to the subject's group.

Results: Ninety-nine women completed the study without any maternal adverse effects. The mean increase in amniotic fluid index after hydration was significantly greater in the isotonic solution and water groups (12.1mm, p=0.02; 13.1mm, p=0.05; respectively) than the control group (1.4mm, p=0.74). There was no significant difference between the isotonic solution and water groups.

16429,NCT02994303,2019-08,ESTIMATED,"In patients with Fabry disease, this research study explores the presence of podocytes in their urine as a potential non-invasive biomarker for baseline kidney disease; and explores changes in the quantity of podocytes in their urine over time as a predictor for kidney disease progression. To accomplish this, the investigators will evaluate the quantification of podocytes in the urine of Fabry disease patients at baseline and longitudinally over time. This study requires a single patient visit, during which the patient provides a urine specimen. The research team will then collect the patient's kidney function data proximate to the time of urine collection, and follow the patient's kidney function data longitudinally over the five years of this study by reviewing their medical charts. The study offers no interventions.","Despite long-term recombinant enzyme replacement therapy, kidney failure remains a common and important complication of Fabry disease. Recent studies suggest that early administration of enzyme replacement therapy in sufficient dosage may prevent progression of kidney failure in patients with Fabry disease. Currently, there is no reliable non-invasive biomarker to detect early, occult kidney injury in these patients. Such early kidney injury detection is critical for guiding the decision as to when to initiate enzyme replacement therapy, and for identifying those patients with more severe kidney injury who may need higher doses of enzyme replacement therapy or additional forms of therapy.

Podocytes are special kidney cells with a crucial role in preventing escape of protein from the blood into the urine. Biopsy studies of Fabry disease patients suggest that podocyte injury occurs early and is progressive with increasing age in young Fabry disease patients. It is also likely that podocyte injury and loss leads to irreversible kidney lesions in later stages of Fabry disease nephropathy. Because injured podocytes are sloughed off into the urine (a manifestation known as podocyturia), quantification of urine podocytes might serve as a non-invasive and sensitive biomarker useful for predicting Fabry disease nephropathy risk; and to guide more effective Fabry disease treatment.

The investigators' preliminary data show correlations between presence of urinary podocytes and other markers of renal disease in adult Fabry disease patients; however, these cross-sectional data need to be expanded. The investigators have no information as to whether this potential biomarker could predict progression of the disease.

The investigators hypothesize that since podocyte injury plays a central role in kidney complications of Fabry disease, podocyte loss detected in the urine will identify patients with greater underlying kidney disease, and will identify patients with greater propensity for kidney disease progression. They also hypothesize that the number of podocytes in the urine of patients with Fabry disease will correlate directly with these patients' proteinuria, and will correlate inversely with their glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at baseline. Additionally the investigators hypothesize that the number of podocytes in the urine of patients with Fabry disease will predict increase in proteinuria and decline in glomerular filtration rate, as measured during long-term patient follow-up.

Data to be collected include identification of these patients' GLA gene mutation; measurement of their baseline a-galactosidase A enzyme activity; their baseline age, gender, height and weight; measurement of their baseline serum creatinine (SCr), eGFR, PCR and ACR; these patients' family history of Fabry disease, their history of kidney or systemic diseases, their medications including enzyme replacement therapy, and their medical information about other complications of Fabry disease (such as cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias, neuropathy and gastrointestinal problems).",['Fabry Disease'],OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

247481,NCT05034354,2024-12-31,ESTIMATED,"Infants and children with heart conditions require treatment in children's hospitals that are typically located in large cities. This creates challenges for children and families who need to travel long distances to come to appointments. Providing quality care to children with heart disease has further been challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic, with a shift towards decreased in-person contact and an increase in virtual visits, where assessment by doctors and nurses is more limited.

This research study will look at how families of children with heart disease access care and how investigators can improve care with virtual technologies. This will involve testing a new home-based virtual care platform that uses Bluetooth technology to connect weight scales, oxygen measuring devices and blood pressure cuffs with a smartphone app, allowing parents to easily use these devices and send accurate data directly to the cardiology team. Investigators will obtain feedback from families, patients, and healthcare providers about how this helped or did not help them, and adjust the technology as needed to make it better.","This will be a prospective multi-methods observational study. Investigators will assess the feasibility of the novel home-based remote physiological monitoring (RPM) system paired to a smartphone app (Sphygmo™) and linked to a secure physician platform. The study team will enroll caregivers of medically high- risk infants with CHD and children and caregivers with heart failure or early post heart transplant. In addition, investigators will obtain feedback from their healthcare providers. Qualitative analysis of semi- structured interviews will determine patient and parent/caregiver and healthcare providers experience with the system and allow for future modifications specific to pediatrics.

Purposive sampling will be used to achieve a maximum variation and will ensure a diverse group of patients/caregivers that represent a variety of patient profiles. The study team aim to recruit 10 participants in each group, with 50% of the patients living at least 100 km drive from the Stollery.

Medical records will be accessed to collect baseline characteristics including date of birth, sex, postal code, diagnoses, surgeries and procedures. The number of pediatric cardiology clinic visits, hospitalizations, ED visits, and cardiac investigations in the last 2 years will be collected to describe the patients requirements for access to cardiac care. In addition, the family will be asked to complete a demographic form that compiles information about parents' ethnicity, education level, SES, access to Wi-FI and iOS/Android devices in the home.

An emerging, qualitative descriptive approach will be used to explore patient and parents' experiences using the RPM devices and app in their home as part of their daily care routine. Data collection and analysis will occur iteratively to allow emerging ideas. Semi-structured interviews with parents/patients/healthcare providers will be conducted by a qualitatively trained members of the study team. Data collection will occur until saturation (data redundancy) is achieved.

People living with sickle cell disease have numerous complications that cause significant morbidity and mortality such as painful episodes of vasoocclusion, acute chest syndrome, stroke, end organ damage, and early death. Unfortunately, their lifespan remains markedly shorter than the general population and this had not dramatically changed in the last 2 decades. Adults, are now not dying primarily from infections and sickle cell disease related complications, but cardiopulmonary disease is a leading cause of death. The etiology of cardiopulmonary disease in sickle cell disease is unclear but studies suggest that microvascular hypoxia, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction play a major role in the pathogenesis. In the general population, exercise reduces cardiovascular complications, pulmonary exacerbations, and decreases cardiovascular death. However, exercise used as primary or secondary prevention in sickle cell disease for cardiopulmonary disease has not been explored. Evidence shows that exercise in sickle cell disease can decrease oxidative stress, lower blood viscosity, and increase nitric oxide levels in both human and mouse models, but there remains some concern that high-intensity training in sickle cell disease may trigger vaso-occlusive crisis and adverse outcomes. However, multiple recent studies show that moderate intensity exercise can be safely performed in adults with sickle cell disease. Currently, providers lack evidence-based knowledge to inform the quantity and quality of regular exercise training that is safe but also improves cardiovascular outcomes in sickle cell disease. In addition, data does not exist on the feasibility and adherence of home-based training regimens in adults with sickle cell disease. Only one study has explored the feasibility and adherence in children. This study will be a qualitative assessment of potential interventions of exercises in adults with sickle cell anemia, only including the more severe genotypes of sickle cell disease.","['Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Sickle Cell Disease', 'Exercise']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

496616,NCT03557151,2022-03-31,ACTUAL,"This study will consist of a randomized controlled trial to test a novel Transdisciplinary Care (TC) model of delivery of care for type 1 diabetes in adolescence. Adolescents and their parents/caregivers (n=150) will be randomized to Usual Care or TC care in a 1:2 ratio. Approximately half of those in TC care will received TC in person and half will receive it through telehealth. TC visits will consist of conjoint management of T1D by a TC team consisting of an Advanced Practice Nurse, Dietitian and Psychologist who will see parent-adolescent dyads together within the same visit. TC team members have trained each other in their respective disciplines. Outcome measures include glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) and questionnaires assessing diabetes self management behaviors. Other ancillary/exploratory measures are also completed.","Large epidemiologic studies show that \<25% of adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) achieve targeted glycohemoglobin levels advocated by the American Diabetes Association (\< 7.5%) or International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (\< 7.0%). Optimal self-management of T1D requires daily insulin replacement by multiple injections or insulin pump, 4-6 daily blood glucose checks, regulation of carbohydrate intake and physical activity, prevention/correction of glycemic fluctuations and perhaps use of a continuous glucose monitor. This regimen places pervasive affective, behavioral, cognitive and social demands on adolescents with T1D and their families and psychosocial variables greatly impact their success in T1D self-care. Struggling with maintaining adequate glycemic control is essentially normative among adolescents, suggesting that conventional systems of care are not meeting the needs of this population. A substantial, growing literature provides an evidence base for psychosocial screening and behavioral intervention strategies targeting improved coping with the demands of T1D, but this evidence base has not penetrated fully into routine T1D care. Rigorous integration of this evidence into routine care for T1D could yield many benefits. Behavioral barriers to effective care are major concerns of all stakeholders, but conventional care is not well-equipped to address these issues. Concomitantly, the supply of board-certified pediatric endocrinologists is not keeping pace with growth of the T1D patient population, amplifying the need to validate alternative delivery systems that multiply the effective workforce of T1D health professionals. We will develop and test a novel Transdisciplinary Care (TC) approach (conjoint TC visits conducted by an Advanced Practice Nurse, Psychology Postdoctoral Fellow and Dietitian) to improve adolescents' T1D outcomes and justify a larger randomized controlled trial (RCT). In Year 1, crowdsourcing methods will engage youths with T1D, parents and health care providers (HCP) in planning a feasible, acceptable, safe and effective TC model that addresses youths' and families' psychosocial needs and capitalizes on the expertise of advanced practice nurses co-managing T1D with psychologists and dietitians. The Wallander et al. stress and coping model and the D'Zurilla and Goldfried problem solving model provide a sound conceptual framework for the TC model of care. The TC team will learn each discipline's skills in T1D management, develop a detailed TC manual to guide this work and others' future studies, see adolescents and parents together as a team, screen for potentially modifiable psychological impediments to T1D care, and promote families' coping resources by enhancing family-centered communication and problem solving, implementing empirically validated behavioral interventions and facilitating additional appropriate services for complex problems. Telehealth delivery of TC care carries several potential advantages, justifying its inclusion within a RCT comparing the effects of UC to TC delivered via various modalities on glycemic control and treatment adherence (primary outcomes) as well as quality of life and other psychosocial variables (exploratory outcomes). Qualitative and economic analyses will follow the RCT, providing perspectives on mechanisms of TC effects and its sustainability. Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods will validate an innovative model of T1D care for adolescents that could then be tested in a future definitive, multi-site RCT.

We will address these specific aims:

SPECIFIC AIM 1. In Year 1, with methods used effectively in our ongoing DP3 study of parents of children \<6 years old with T1D, we will engage separate ""crowds"" of adolescents with T1D, parents, and HCPs in planning/refining a feasible, safe, acceptable and efficacious Trans-Disciplinary care model (TC) for T1D in adolescence. This crowdsourcing effort should yield a TC model that meets the needs of all key stakeholder groups, ensuring its feasibility, acceptance and efficacy.

SPECIFIC AIM 2. With study oversight by a diverse stakeholder panel and guided by a detailed intervention manual, 150 families of adolescents treated for T1D at Nemours practices in the Delaware Valley or Florida will participate in a rigorous Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) in years 2 and 3. The RCT will compare Usual Care (UC) with Trans-Disciplinary Care on glycohemoglobin (HbA1C), treatment adherence, along with exploratory outcomes including health care use, T1D-related distress, quality of life, and treatment satisfaction. Delivery mode of Trans-Disciplinary Care will also be explored (e.g., Face-to-Face, Telehealth, Combined). The proposed trial will yield substantial information that could justify a definitive future test of this model, inform methodological planning for subsequent studies, and explore whether certain modes of delivery (e.g., Telehealth) are justified for evaluation in future trials.

SPECIFIC AIM 3. Qualitative interviews of adolescents, parents, and health care providers completed at the midpoint and end of the RCT will identify possible mediators or moderators of TC efficacy and guide refinements to the TC model. We will interview third party payers about the feasibility of dissemination of the TC model into practice and collect health care cost data.

218033,NCT06037928,2024-01-31,ESTIMATED,"Patients in the Intensive Care Unit often present with low levels of plasma sodium and are therefore often administered high amounts of sodium, both as an additive to intravenous glucose solutions and as a constituent of various drugs and infusion fluids. Recent findings question the benefit of these large quantities of sodium and raise the question whether the individual physician takes the total sodium administration into account when sodium additives are prescribed. It can also be suspected that sodium prescription differs significantly between physicians.","Treatment with intravenous fluids (fluid therapy) is a cornerstone in intensive care. The primary aim of fluid therapy is to optimize the amount of fluid in the various spaces of the body: intravascularly (plasma), intracellularly and interstitially. Secondarily, one tries to optimize the constitution of fluid in plasma, since this is the only fluid space that is available for analysis. Fluid constitution is referring to the physical properties such as pH-value, osmolality, and partly the concentration of different elements solved in plasma (i.e. sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, and proteins like albumin). For this reason, there are a lot of different fluids that the physician in the intensive care can choose from. In addition, the physician can also choose to prescribe different additives to adapt these fluids to fulfil the individual patient's needs. Therefore, to prescribe both the amount and constituency of fluid therapy is a key task for ICU-physicians.

One of the most important additives to be prescribed is sodium. Sodium is the molecule (except for water) that has the highest concentration in plasma (normally around 140 mmol/L) and is therefore of utmost importance for plasma osmolality. Sodium concentration in plasma is often decreased in critically ill patients (hyponatremia) which, in turn, is associated with a worse outcome, and thus a normal task for an ICU-physician to attempt to regulate through administering amounts of sodium that are substantially higher than the physiological needs.

Recent findings have revealed that there is a large variation between different physicians when it comes to the amount of fluid the patient receives, a variation that has no scientific basis.

Fluids used in the operating room and in the intensive care often contain large quantities of sodium to create a physiological osmolality. It is thus hypothesized that it is not only the large quantities of fluid that causes a worse outcome in fluid overload, but also the un-physiologically large amount of administered sodium.

The aim of the study is partly to gain knowledge about how sodium prescription is performed in clinical practice in the intensive care, as well as how this administration relates to actual changes in plasma sodium.

Statistical method: Normal distribution will be tested via the Shapiro-Wilks test. All tests of significance are performed two-sided. P-value lower than 0.05 is considered significant. No corrections for multiple comparisons are performed if nothing else is stated.

Missing values: Single missing values are principally not replaced.

Newer advances such as development of single port laparoscopic surgery and scarless Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery (NOTES) with or without robot assistance have moved forward the practice in ""Minimally Invasive Surgery"".

Described for the first time in 2004 at John Hopkins University in an experimental porcine model, NOTES is a surgical technique in which the natural orifices (mouth, vagina, urethra and rectum) are used as access routes to the peritoneal cavity for endoscopic surgery with no abdominal incisions.

Clinical application of NOTES has been initially reported in general surgical procedures where Trans-gastric Appendectomy and Cholecystectomy have been performed using the mouth and the stomach as the access route.

The technique seems to be feasible and safe when performed by experienced surgeons. Favourable outcomes such as reduced post-operative pain, a shorter length of hospital stay, improved cosmetic results due to scar-free surgery and reduced wound complications at trocar insertion sites, promote the increasing use of this new surgical technique.

Although NOTES may be performed through various entries including the stomach, oesophagus, bladder and rectum, NOTES procedures in women have been commonly performed through the vagina as this allows direct access to the abdominal cavity. Therefore, trans-vaginal NOTES (vNOTES) has gained popularity among general surgeons, urologists and gastroenterologists over the past decade and was adopted in various surgical procedures, varying from cholecystectomy, appendectomy, sigmoidectomy, nephrectomy, splenectomy, liver resection and sleeve gastrectomy.

Recently, clinical application of vNOTES has broadened significantly in the field of gynaecological surgery. The feasibility and safety of vNOTES in this specialty was firstly demonstrated in 2012. This event represented the key milestone in the evolution of vNOTES for gynaecologic procedures. Based on the current reports, we know that many of these procedures, such as oophorectomy, salpingectomy, adnexectomy, hysterectomy and many other more complex surgeries can be performed using vNOTES by the majority of surgeons who have adequate skills in performing laparoscopy.

As the application of vNOTES is increasing, it is deemed mandatory to assess the learning curve (LC) of this novel technique. This is particularly important in surgery where new skills must be acquired constantly, safely and proficiently. It would be useful to know how many vNOTES procedures a surgeon may have to carry out before reaching an adequate level of safety and efficiency. Furthermore, a correct understanding of the LC is essential in randomised control trials comparing vNOTES with alternative types of surgery in order to reach valid conclusions.

There is a paucity of reports in the literature analysing the LC of vNOTES. The ""learning curves"" for performing vNOTES hysterectomy and adnexal surgery have been previously assessed by retrospective studies, each conducted on a single surgeon basis and in a single institution (19-21). In a report published in June 2020, Lowenstein et al were among the first researchers that evaluated prospectively the learning curve of mastering the skills to perform vNOTES hysterectomy and uterosacral ligament suspension in two different centres.

219564,NCT05904028,2027-07-30,ESTIMATED,Home optical coherence tomography- guided treatment versus treat and extend for the management of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"Treatment of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD) with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy is highly effective but is associated with considerable treatment burden and cost for patients and the healthcare system. One of the principal barriers to reducing burden and cost is that the optimal number of injections needed to achieve best visual acuity and disease control for any one person is unknown. At present, there are several algorithms that modestly reduce treatment burden, but at the expense of overtreatment in some patients and less optimal disease control in others. The lack of precision in disease management may be due in part to the low frequency of disease monitoring, which typically occurs every one to two months by standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging during an office visit. Home OCT imaging allows daily disease activity monitoring and the possibility of a tailored and more personalized approach to managing neovascular AMD. To understand the role of Home OCT in clinical practice, it is essential to perform a randomized clinical trial that compares visual acuity outcomes, and visit and injection frequencies, obtained using a Home OCT-guided treatment strategy versus outcomes obtained using ""Treat and Extend,"" the treatment algorithm widely perceived to be the most common regimen in clinical practice today.

The main objective of this study is to determine if Home OCT-guided treatment results in 1) better visual acuity outcomes and/or 2) fewer number of injections over 104 weeks compared with treat and extend (T\&E) dosing for nAMD.

Upon completion of baseline testing procedures, eligible study eyes will enter the run-in phase and be given an injection of study faricimab. If the non-study eye also has nAMD and needs an injection, study faricimab must be used unless the protocol chair has approved of an alternative anti-VEGF. The participant will be provided with a post-injection instruction sheet and will be reminded that the site will follow-up regarding eligibility for the randomization phase. The Notal Vision Monitoring Center must confirm adequate scan quality from the study eye prior to randomization. Once Notal Vision Monitoring Center confirms acceptable scans, randomization can be completed. The participant does not need to be present in the office for randomization. Randomization of eligible study eyes must occur within 10 days of the baseline visit. Prior to randomization, the site must call the participant to confirm they are still willing to participate and agree to follow the daily Home OCT scan requirement if randomized to the Home OCT group. Sites will also confirm the participant's understanding of the trial, willingness to accept the assigned treatment group, and commitment to the follow-up schedule, and compliance with device use.

Procedures at the baseline visit include eligibility assessment, vision testing, ocular examination, various imaging, and test session on the in-office Home OCT device. Eligible study eyes will enter the run-in phase and receive a baseline intravitreal faricimab injection. Participants must meet criteria for successful scanning as confirmed by Notal Vision for eligibility into the randomization phase. Eyes eligible for the randomization phase will be randomly assigned 1:1 into one of two groups to guide follow-up treatment: (1) Treat and Extend or (2) Home OCT-guided treatment.

Eyes receiving an initial faricimab injection that are not eligible for the randomization phase will have a final closeout safety visit 1 month after injection. For eyes in the randomization phase, follow-up for treatment group comparisons of vision and imaging outcomes will occur at 52- and 104-week visits. Additional visits will occur every 4-18 weeks in the T\&E group. Participants assigned to the Home OCT group will self-scan daily using the Home OCT device and will only return for a visit if fluid passing the threshold for an office visit is seen on Home OCT. Follow-up visit procedures include vision testing, ocular exam, and various imaging. The primary outcomes are a comparison of mean change in visual acuity and number of injections from baseline to 104 weeks between the Home OCT vs. T\&E groups (study eye only).",['Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Key Inclusion Criteria:

Epidemiological studies in Nigeria suggest that the burden of chronic low back pain (CLBP) in rural areas is greater than in urban areas, with both biomechanical and psychological factors being implicated. However, despite the burden of CLBP in rural Nigeria, rehabilitation services are lacking even at the rural primary healthcare centers due to the absence of physiotherapists. Current clinical practice guidelines unanimously recommend education including instruction on self-management options, and exercise as frontline interventions to help individuals with CLBP. However, the specific content of these interventions are rarely described. Patient education (PE) strategies incorporating both biomedical and psychosocial information have been shown to be beneficial for CLBP. Moreover, exercises in the form of motor control exercises (MCEs) have been proven to be effective for CLBP. However, RCTs examining the effects of PE and MCE individually or in combination among rural community-dwelling adults with CLBP are scarce.

Characteristic neuroimaging abnormalities including severe intraventricular (IVH) hydrocephalus and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), stroke or ischemia with lesions affect the posterior limb of the internal capsule are strong Indicators of high-risk for CP, especially when combined with abnormal General Movements Assessment (Guidelines for Early Detection of CP; Stockholm, 2016). Early intervention, when plasticity is greatest has the largest impact on functional recovery in CP. While intervening in infancy involves treating some infants who will not develop CP, the goal is to establish new neuronal connections and functional patterns before less efficient adaptations can occur. However, no current interventions target the oral-motor dysfunction of infants at high-risk for CP, before their discharge from the NICU.

Evidence for behavioral interventions in feeding disorders for children with CP ranges from insufficient to moderate, with a clear need for rigorous studies. In healthy preterm and late-preterm infants, oromotor practice opportunities such as non-nutritive suck (NNS) are safe and promote effective suck-swallow-breathe patterns, with decreased time to achieving oral feeds. While NNS opportunities are frequent in most NICUs, they must be adapted for effectiveness in infants at high-risk for CP. Motor learning in these infants must incorporate repetitive, self-initiated and task-directed activities. Learning is optimized when contingent on feedback, such as positive reinforcement.

NNS training (rather than simple exposure) has been implemented successfully using rhythmic sound of mother's voice singing contingent upon suck strength and pattern, as detected by a pacifier-sensor device (Pacifier-activated music; PAM) in an cohort of predominantly healthy preterm infants. An RCT demonstrated that NNS-trained infants had feeding tubes removed one week earlier than controls, with fewer aspiration events and feeding difficulties in infancy. The intervention was promising in the dozen infants with significant neural injury. Following this preliminary data, this study seeks to further determining the efficacy of non-nutritive suck (NNS) training using a pacifier-activated device (PAM) with mothers' voice to condition suck-strength and rhythmicity, in improving the feeding and developmental outcomes of infants at high-risk for CP.","['Infant Development', 'Infant,Premature', 'Hydrocephalus', 'Neonatal Encephalopathy', 'Infarction', 'PVL', 'Thrombosis', 'Intraventricular Hemorrhage']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Materials and methods: Eight consecutive patients ready for a full-arch rehabilitation on already osseointegrated implants were selected. Two sets of impressions were taken, one open tray with polyether and splinted impression copings and a second one with an intraoral scanner. A verification plaster jig was used for the elastomeric impression and a prefabricated auxiliary device was used to adjust the optical intraoral impressions. Two full-zirconia frameworks with the same design were processed and tested on the patient by two independent calibrated operators. Accuracy of both frameworks was measured by calibrated blinded operators, who determined tactile adjustment, Sheffield test, radiographic adjustment, and screwing torque. Overall perception of adjustment was used to determine the better framework to be delivered to the patient.

Hº: Frameworks obtained from an impression taken with an intraoral scanner are not inferior in accuracy to those obtained from a conventional elastomeric impression","Eight consecutive patients ready for a full-arch rehabilitation on previously osseointegrated implants, and who had received an immediately loaded prosthesis, were selected. All implants had multiunit abutments placed on top. Cases from 4 to 6 implants were accepted, either upper or lower arches. Three sets of impressions were taken to each patient:

Conventional impression:

Open tray impression copings were screwed on top of all implants in the arch using a torque wrench set at 10 N/cm. Impression copings were splinted by means of Triad Gel clear resin, with an at least 3mm diameter in the resin connectors. Once the resin was photo-polymerized a cut was done in the centre of each connection with a 0.3 mm bur, to eliminate possible stress in the structure, and then it was splinted again with a drop of Triad Gel in each cut. A polyether impression was taken by means of a perforated plastic tray, and a master model was fabricated following the manufacturer's instructions. A plaster verification jig was fabricated on the model. After one week the patient came to the dental clinic where vertical dimension of occlusion was determined and the plaster key was screwed in the patient mouth to check passivity. In case the key had been fractured, a new impression would have been taken, and if not, final prosthesis could be processed.

Optical impression:

An impression of the antagonist and an impression of the edentulous arch with the healing abutments in place were taken by means of an optical scanner following the manufacturers protocol. The position of the implants was marked in the working standard tessellation language (STL) model, and the software cut a circle on top of those areas. The files were copied, and two datasets were obtained.

Scan-bodies were placed on top of each multiunit abutment, the first STL dataset was open and a second impression was taken, so that the scan-bodies were positioned on the working file.

Scan-bodies were then removed from the patient mouth, and temporary copings were placed on top of each multiunit abutment. A MedicalFit device was selected, and holes were drilled in the position of the implants until it fitted on top of all the cylinders. Cylinders were then splinted to MedicalFit device by means of Triad Gel clear. The device was then removed from the patient mouth and scan implant replicas were placed at the bottom of the metal cylinders. Finally, the device with the scan implant replicas was scanned with an intraoral optical scanner.

The following set of pictures were taken: Rest position, maximum smile (with the scan bodies placed in the mouth), front with retractors (with the scan bodies), and 45º with retractors (also with the scan bodies in place).

All pictures and STL datasets were sent to the dental technician to produce a temporary structure. The STL dataset from the scanning of Medicalfit device used was adjusted to the original STL dataset of the device in the library, and then superimposed to the dataset of the scan-bodies received from us, to allow repositioning of the scan-bodies and to correct possible discrepancies during the intraoral scanning process.

A temporary polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) framework was delivered by the dental lab and tried in the patient mouth. Corrections were done to adjust occlusion, gingival contour and esthetic parameters where needed. Once esthetic parameters and occlusal scheme were considered correct, a new intraoral scanning was taken with the temporary framework in place. In case changes were done in the gingival contour, scanning of the gingival aspect of the PMMA framework was also done. The PMMA temporary was then left in the patient mouth.

Three pictures were taken with the PMMA framework placed in the mouth: Front full face at rest, front full-face smiling, front full face with separators and full face smiling at 45º.

Clinical adjustment assessment:

After one week two sets of the final prosthesis in full-zirconia were sent from the dental lab, one processed with conventional models and the second fully digital. Both sets were tested in the patient mouth by two calibrated blinded independent operators.

Misfit should be ideally measured in terms smaller than 10 microns, but clinical adjustment is difficult to assess using conventional or quantitative methods. In this research adjustment was assessed following four criteria: passivity in the insertion of the screws, tactile sensation, radiographs and screwing torque:

1. A Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) was used to assess the perception of passivity in the insertion of the prosthodontic screws. A ten centimeters line will be shown to the observer. One side of the line represents ""perfect passivity"", and the other ""no passive at all"". The observer will mark his passivity perception on the line between the two endpoints. The distance between ""no passivity at all"" and the mark will defines the passivity perception.
2. Examination of the marginal fit with an exploratory probe (#23/3 explorer) under 3,8x magnification. Three possible scores were possible: 0 (no gap perceived when probing), 1 (perception of the gap without entering it) and 2 (the tip of the explorer clearly entered the gap).
3. Periapical radiographs were taken with a positioning system to evaluate possible gaps. Five possible scores were possible from 1 to 5, being 1 no gap and increasing 0.15 mm each score until reaching 0.60 mm in score 5.
4. Digital photographs were taken with a 105 mm macro lens. The pictures were calibrated with the known height of the framework and the gap was measured. Four possible scores were possible, being 1 no gap and increasing 0.25 mm each score until reaching 0.75 mm in score 5.
5. Screwing torque on each abutment was measured with the app software from Ichiropro motor (BienAir, Bienne, Switzerland). All screws were hand screwed and then all but the most distal right were unscrewed. Torque was set at 15 N/cm and speed at 5 rpm. The most right distal screw was tightened first, and then the rest of the screws were tightened starting at the most mesial left, following to the most distal left, and from that to the next neighbor implant until all screws were tightened. The torque-time signature was studied in every screw to determine if the torque started to grow just at the end of the tightening or throughout the process. Three scores were possible: 1 for linear value with a fast increase at end of the tightening, 2 for soft continuous growth with a steeper increase at the end, 3 for steep increase at the beginning of tightening.

Once the assessment of the two frameworks was completed, the framework with better adjustment will be placed in the patient, after assessing the presence of correct occlusion, phonetics and esthetic parameters. The second set will be packed and delivered to the patient as a possible replacement in case of problems in the future.",['Edentulous Jaw'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

231167,NCT05984498,2024-05-01,ESTIMATED,"This study is an observational study investigating the mechanisms of balance problems in people with COPD and how COPD impacts them living their daily lives.

The main objectives of this study are:

* To quantify the relationship between balance and aspects of neuromuscular function in individuals with COPD, and compared to age-matched healthy controls
* To understand the lived experience of people with COPD and their carers

Participants will attend an appointment at the University rehab lab to:

* Complete a balance test
* Fill out some questionnaires on mood, health status and balance and falls
* Complete some walking tests
* Have their body composition measured
* Have the function and strength of their leg nerves and muscles tested Researchers will compare people with COPD and healthy controls (older adults without COPD or other conditions known to impact balance) to see if any of the things measured are impacting the balance of people with COPD more than their peers without COPD.
* For 10 people with COPD only they will be visited at home to observe how they carry out everyday tasks and 5 of those 10 will have a follow up interview.

Researchers will take notes and record interviews and look for similarities and interesting points in the notes and transcripts of the interviews to build a picture of what living with COPD is like.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive condition that affects around 1.2million people in the UK. Breathlessness is the main symptom but people with COPD are also more likely to fall than healthy people of the same age. Falling has emotional consequences, such as feelings of shame, embarrassment and fear of falling in public which leads to avoidance of outdoor activities. Researchers do not know why people with COPD fall more but they have poor balance which may, in part, be due to problems with sensory and muscle responses that would usually maintain balance. Symptoms of breathlessness and pain, plus inactivity, may further impact balance. Physical and social environments may also have a role in falls risk, but this has yet to be investigated. Pulmonary Rehabilitation (PR) which includes stamina and strength exercises, alongside education and emotional support is standard treatment for COPD but it does not include any balance exercises, meaning people with COPD who are at a greater risk of falling do not receive any routine treatment to improve balance. This study aims to investigate the physical, psychological, social and environmental factors impacting on balance in people with COPD by comparing them to older adults without COPD. The study will recruit from local hospital services (people with COPD and their carers without COPD) and within the community (healthy older adults). Balance, muscle function (size, strength and speed of nerve conduction) and physical activity will be measured, and the two groups compared. Researchers will also observe patients in their own homes and do follow up interviews to understand what it is like to live with COPD and the challenges people face. The information from this study will be used in conjunction with stakeholders to co design an intervention to improve balance in people with COPD.","['Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease', 'Healthy Volunteers']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

68503,NCT04614792,2023-12-27,ACTUAL,"In response to ""conscious"" EEG findings related to detectable cognitive function that reliably denote awareness in vegetative state patients, in the current study, we will assess the covert conscious EEG activity (as well as standard clinical overt measures) and neuroplasctic propensity (i.e., changes in EEG spectral power synchronization values following tDCS intervention) in vegetative-state patients receiving repetitive transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) treatment over frontal motor areas for a period of two weeks. In support of this approach, a recent tDCS study with vegetative and minimally conscious patients implied that a twenty minutes anodal stimulation (i.e., excitatory stimulation) to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) significantly increased CRS-R scores versus sham (placebo: non-active stimulation) stimulation condition. It was noted that this tDCS effect was more pronounced in minimally conscious state patients versus vegetative state patients excluding effects of chronicity or etiology. Thus, the investigators in this study suggested that tDCS could be effective in improving cognitive recovery in severely brain-injured patients. However, their findings would benefit neural activation correlates that could support their conclusion regarding the effectiveness of this type of non-invasive intervention in promoting neurocognitive recovery. Most importantly, tDCS is safe for use in humans, has no adverse effects, is considered the most non-invasive transcranial stimulation method because it uses extremely weak currents (0.5 to 2 mA), and, is known to only temporarily shift the neuron's membrane potential towards excitation/inhibition. In regard to the method's potential to induce functional recovery in vegetative state patients, recent clinical studies indicate that tDCS could counteract the negative effects of brain damage by influencing neurophysiological mechanisms, and is likely to contribute to the ""formation of functionally meaningful connections and the maintenance of existing pathways"" .",,"['Disorder of Consciousness', 'MMN', 'Modification of Cognitive Status Indication', 'Anoxic Brain Damage', 'Trauma, Brain', 'Vegetative State', 'EEG; Paroxysms, Occipital, Epilepsy of Childhood', 'Cortical Atrophy']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The study will include patients with focal pancreatic masses evaluated by CEH-EUS and EUS-FNA. The diagnosis is usually unknown in the moment of the initial evaluation, the patients being included based on a suspicion of focal pancreatic masses after transabdominal ultrasound, CT or MR examinations. However, after a complete evaluation, a final diagnosis will be reached based on the combination of EUS-FNA cytology/pathology, surgical pathology and minimum 12 months follow-up.","Ultrasound contrast agents in conjunction with contrast specific imaging techniques are increasingly accepted in clinical use for diagnostic imaging. The study of the pancreas is a new and promising application of contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CE-US), including contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasound (CE-EUS). The technique is not indicated to improve the detection of pancreatic lesions, but to improve the delineation and differential diagnosis of pancreatic lesions. One of the fluoro-gas-containing contrast agents used in CE-US and CE-EUS is Sonovue®, which consists of phospholipids-stabilized bubbles of sulfurhexafluoride (SF6). Sonovue® is isotonic, stable and resistant to pressure, with a viscosity similar to blood. It does not diffuse into the extravascular compartment remaining within the blood vessels until the gas dissolves and is eliminated in the expired air (blood pool contrast agent). The safety profile of SonoVue showed a very low incidence of side effects; it is not nephrotoxic and the incidence of severe hypersensitivity is similar to other magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents. Moreover, Sono-Vue is approved for clinical use in EU countries. The blood supply of the pancreas is entirely arterial, making contrast-enhanced examinations feasible and readily available. Based on the European Federation Societies of Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology guidelines and recommendations, updated in 2008, two phases were defined for CE-US and CE-EUS of the pancreas: an early/arterial phase (starting from 10 to 30 seconds) and a venous/late phase (from 30 to 120 seconds).

Distinguishing pancreatic adenocarcinoma from other pancreatic masses remains challenging with current imaging techniques. The specificity of the discrimination between benign and malignant focal pancreatic lesions was found to be 93.3% using power Doppler contrast-enhanced EUS (PD-CE-EUS) compared with 83.3% for conventional EUS. The hypovascular aspect of lesions under PD-CE-EUS seemed highly sensitive and specific (higher than 90%) for adenocarcinoma in several published studies. During PD-CE-EUS examinations the ultrasound frequency returned to the transducer is the same with that transmitted, but the method is associated with artifacts resulting from turbulent flow (flash and overpainting). At CE-EUS, ductal adenocarcinoma is typically hypoenhanced compared to the adjacent pancreatic tissue in all phases. Furthermore, the lesion size and margins are better visualized, as well as the relationship with peripancreatic arteries and veins. Focal lesions in chronic pancreatitis are reported to have similar or hyper enhancement features as compared to the normal pancreatic parenchyma.

Dedicated contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS techniques (based on a low mechanical index) are recently available in new EUS systems. The harmonic frequencies returned during CEH-EUS are different from those transmitted by the transducer and are the result of non-linear oscillations of the microbubbles. The image obtained is an addition of the signal created by the distortion of the microbubbles and the tissue-derived signal. This can be optimized by using low MI, which allows minimum bubble destruction and complete ""subtraction"" of the tissue derived signal, obtaining a high resolution continuous real-time assessment of the microvascularization during the contrast uptake period (real-time perfusion imaging). CEH-EUS allows a more precise location of vascular structures within the parenchyma and focal abnormalities, with better delineation of pancreatic lesions than EUS, especially in the cases where air or fat causes artifacts and insufficient visualization of the pancreatic parenchyma. An initial pilot study described an experimental technique of CEH-EUS based on a linear prototype EUS scope, a low mechanical index (0.08 - 0.25) and a 2nd generation contrast agent (Sono-Vue), which allowed the visualization of early arterial phase and late parenchymal phase enhancement of the pancreas. Another pilot study demonstrated both real-time continuous images of finely branching vessels of the pancreas and intermittent homogenous parenchymal perfusion images, by using a radial prototype EUS scope, a low mechanical index (0.4) and a 2nd generation contrast agent (Sono-Vue). Several other research groups already reported the feasibility of CEH-EUS with low mechanical index. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for diagnosing pancreatic adenocarcinoma were 88%, 89%, and 88.5% in one study and 80%, 91.7%, and 86% in the other study. However, the data is still limited and a prospective, multicentric blinded study would certainly be necessary.

The study design is prospective, blinded and multi-center, comparing contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound (CEH-EUS) results for the detection and characterization of focal pancreatic masses, in comparison with the gold standard represented by pathology. The study will be performed with the approval of the institutional board review of each center. The study protocol will be uploaded on ClinicalTrials.gov, the registry of federally and privately supported clinical trials conducted in the United States and around the world.

The study is already approved by the ethical committee of the University of Medicine and Pharmacy Craiova, Romania (attached). According to EFSUMB (European Federation Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology) guidelines published in 2008, second-generation contrast agents are also approved in the E.U. for ultrasound examinations, including liver and pancreas examinations.

All patients with a suspicion (clinical, US, CT/MR) of pancreatic masses should undergo EUS, contrast-enhanced harmonic EUS and EUS-elastography, as well as EUS-FNA

EUS with EUS-guided FNA

* Protocol of EUS with EUS-FNA should include linear EUS instruments with complete examinations of the pancreas.
* Tumor characteristics (echogenicity, echostructure, size) will be described as well as presence / absence of power Doppler signals.
* EUS-FNA will be performed in all pancreatic masses with at least three passes
* All examiners should be blinded for the results of pathology

CEH-EUS procedure

* A two panel image with the usual conventional gray-scale B-mode EUS image on the right side and with the contrast harmonic image on the left side will be used, according to pre-established presets.
* A low mechanical index procedure (dynamic wide-band contrast harmonic imaging mode) will be used, with a mechanical index of 0.08-0.25 and corresponding powers.
* The starting point of the timer will be considered the moment of intravenous contrast injection (Sonovue 4.8 mL).
* CEH-EUS will be performed during usual EUS examinations, with the whole movie (T0-T120s) recorded on the embedded HDD of the ultrasound system, for later analysis.
* In order to minimize human bias, all post-processing and computer analysis of digital movies will be performed within the coordinating IT Center, with all programmers and statisticians being blinded to the clinical, imaging and pathological data.

EUS-elastography procedures

* An additional EUS elastography movie of 30 seconds should be saved on the embedded HDD.
* The following settings will be used for EUS elastography: examination frequency is usually set at 7.5 MHz, while preinstalled system settings are used in all patients: reject (2), E-smoothing (2), persistence (3), and E-dynamic range (4).

Final diagnosis The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis will be based on the clinical information (history of alcohol abuse, previous diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis or diabetes mellitus), as well as a combination of imaging methods (ultrasound, CT and EUS). At least four criteria of chronic pancreatitis during EUS will be considered for the positive diagnosis. The diagnosis of chronic pseudotumoral pancreatitis will always be confirmed by surgery or by a follow-up of at least six months used to exclude malignancy in the patients that will not be operated on.

A positive cytological diagnosis will be taken as a final proof of malignancy of the pancreas mass. The diagnoses obtained by EUS-FNA will be further verified either by surgery or during a clinical follow-up of at least 6 months.

Pathology samples obtained from duodeno-pancreatectomies or caudal pancreatectomies done with curative intent, as well as microhistological fragments obtained through EUS-FNA biopsy will be processed by paraffin embedding with usual colorations (haematoxylin-eosin), with subsequent immune-histochemistry at the discretion of the participating centers pathologists in order to exclude neuroendocrine tumors / pancreatic metastases.

The patients will be followed-up for at least six months through clinical examination, biological exams and transabdominal ultrasound, eventually with a repeat spiral CT / EUS after six months.

Statistical analysis All results will be expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Differences between the patients with pancreatic cancer and chronic pancreatitis will performed by the two-sample t-test (two independent samples). Since this parametric method makes assumptions about normality and similar variances, we will initially perform both the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk W normality tests and verify the equality of variances assumption with the F test. In the case of the two-sample t-test, we will also perform the non-parametric alternative given by the Mann-Whitney U test, since in some instances it may even offer greater power to reject the null hypothesis than the t-test.

Since with more than two groups of observations it is far better to use a single analysis that enables us to look at all the data in the same time, we will also perform the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) method with the same baseline assumptions. A p-value less than 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.

Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of CEH-EUS +/- will be determined in comparison with the final diagnosis.

The estimated number of patients included is at least 210, based on at least 10 centers with at least 20 patients each, which will be enrolled in an 18 months period. The power analysis was based on the following assumption: in order to use the powerful t-test for independent samples, a sample size equaling 105 patients in each group is sufficient to provide 95% statistical power to detect a difference of 5% in mean, for a type I error alpha = 0.05, and the population standard deviation = 10%. The difference in mean was based on previously published data which report an accuracy of approximately 80-85% for EUS-FNA, and 90% for contrast-enhanced EUS.","['Adenocarcinoma Pancreas', 'Chronic Pancreatitis']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Anticoagulation is efficient to prevent recurrence but is currently not recommended for patient with an intermediate risk of recurrence.

Identifying risk factors of recurrent PE remains a major issue to identify sub-groups of patients who would require lifelong anticoagulation.

In 30-40% of cases, PE patients develop residual pulmonary vascular obstruction (RPVO), which has been found to be associated with an increased recurrence risk. This last observation was mostly reported in patients with unprovoked PE (patients with high risk of recurrence) and RPVO was measured using conventional planar lung scan.

In patients with an intermediate risk of recurrence, the impact of RPVO has been much less studied. In addition, the definition of RPVO was variable according to studies and correlation between RPVO burden and recurrence risk has not been clearly demonstrated. This might be explained by the inherent limitation of RPVO quantification using conventional planar imaging, which is only based on a visual estimation on 2-dimensional images.

Ventilation/Perfusion Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (V/Q SPECT/CT) is a new method of scintigraphic image acquisition that offers the advantage of 3-dimensional imaging, enabling more accurate and reproducible quantification of RPVO.

The secondary objectives are to characterize the microbiome associated with oral mucositis, measure salivary proinflammatory cytokines, and evaluate other clinical indicators of the intervention. Participants will be enrolled prior to beginning radiation and/or chemotherapy, and will be randomized to receive either the oral health protocol or standard of care oral hygiene.","Oral mucositis (OM) is one of the most debilitating adverse effects in cancer patients treated with chemotherapy or radiation (RT). Currently, there are no effective therapies or prevention for mucositis, while several clinical studies have suggested that professional oral care could effectively reduce the severity of Radiation Therapy or chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis. Palliative treatment, rather than preventive or curative measures, remains the standard of care. Evidence-based guidelines do not provide consistent recommendations for the prevention, treatment and management of oral mucositis.

The investigators hypothesize that a monitored regimen of professional oral hygiene prevents harmful ecological shifts in the oral cavity, improve oral health and reduce the duration and severity of Oral Mucositis in cancer patients, consequently improving their overall quality of life during treatment. Moreover, the investigators hypothesize that the weekly oral hygiene regimen performed by an oral health professional is more effective in treating and preventing mucositis than current standard-of-care treatments.

The principal investigator of this project has developed a novel oral care regimen protocol for the treatment of oral mucositis. The ""Oral Mucosa Deterging and Periodontal Debridement"" (OMDP) protocol consists of a regimen of frequent professional oral prophylaxis including tooth cleaning, tooth polishing and flossing, and the debridement of the periodontium and deterging of the oral mucosa. This is an intervention that is implemented prior to and maintained throughout the entire cycle of the radiation or chemoradiation. Co-adjuvant treatments such as intense fluoride treatments, oral hygiene instructions and palliative mouth-rinses are also part of the protocol. The hypothesis is that repeated professional prophylaxis of the oral cavity would protect the healthy oral tissue against infection and inflammation often associated with severe cases of mucositis, and consequently reduces mucositis incidence and duration.

Participants in this study would attend approximately 9 study visits over the course of 16-18 weeks, depending on their specific cancer treatment plan. Study participants will be randomized to receive either the oral health protocol, which they will receive on a weekly basis, or standard of care oral hygiene instructions and tooth brushing, preformed on a bi-weekly basis.","['Oral Mucositis', 'Oral Cancer']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

366884,NCT00621257,2011-03,ACTUAL,"Research has shown that children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease may have lower levels of vitamin D than healthy children, especially in the winter. Vitamin D is important for growing and maintaining healthy bones throughout life, and this is particularly important, since children with IBD frequently have low bone density. It may also be helpful in the treatment of IBD itself, because it helps reduce inflammation. Vitamin D levels are measured by the amount of 25 OHD in the blood; however, measuring this level on a regular basis is not yet the standard for children with IBD. The purpose of this study is to find the best way to treat low vitamin D levels, and to maintain good vitamin D levels throughout the year. It will also test whether having higher vitamin D levels will improve the bone health of children with IBD, and whether it will help them have milder disease.","Vitamin D is essential for bone mineralization. The prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency \[serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D concentration (25OHD) ≤ 20 ng/mL\] is high among adults with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and even higher in pediatric patients with IBD. Protein-losing enteropathy could represent both an etiologic factor for hypovitaminosis D, and an obstacle in treating it in IBD patients. There are currently no guidelines for the treatment of hypovitaminosis D in adults or children with IBD. Moreover we have obtained evidence that optimal vitamin D stores (25OHD ≥32 ng/mL) may not be maintained throughout the year in patients with IBD following current RDA recommendations. On the other hand, the prevalence of low bone mineral density is high among young patients with IBD, during a period in their lives when they should experience the most rapid acquisition of bone mass. Optimization of vitamin D status and its impact on the bone health of children with IBD has not been studied. In addition, vitamin D may play an important role in the regulation of the immune system as supported by animal models of colitis and in vitro human studies.

Prospective studies of the effect of vitamin D supplementation on disease outcomes have not been undertaken in children with IBD to date. We aim to perform a) a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of 3 regimens in treating vitamin D insufficiency in pediatric patients with IBD over a period of 6 weeks. We will also evaluate the effects of each regimen on markers of bone resorption, bone formation and parathyroid hormone levels, and the relationship between the magnitude of gastrointestinal protein loss, as reflected by clearance of fecal alpha -1-antitrypsin, and the efficacy of the treatment. b) We also aim to perform a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of 2 regimens of different doses of oral vitamin D2 in maintaining optimal vitamin D stores in pediatric patients with IBD over a period of 2 years.

74400,NCT02428829,2019-12,ACTUAL,"This study looks to examine the effect of attempting initial postoperative walking with a patient following a total hip replacement. Currently patients rest in bed for approximately 24 hours following their operation before walking. The intervention group would aim to commence walking at between 4-6 hours after their operation.

Outcome measures to be examined would be: length of hospital stay, patient experience of physiotherapy treatment, the time taken for patients to reach functional milestones and number of postoperative medical complications.

The study is designed as a randomised controlled trial where participants would be separated randomly into two groups. One group would form the intervention group and start physiotherapy and attempted walking 4-6 hours after their operation. The other group would form the control group and would remain on the current standard rehabilitation protocol.","As part of this study, patients who are waiting for a total hip replacement, and have no other serious medical problems will be given an information sheet about the study at the preoperative education group session approximately 12 weeks prior to their surgery. If they are interested they would be asked on the day of their operation if they would like to take part in the study, potential participants will have had the opportunity to ask any questions to a senior member of the research team over the telephone or at a further study specific appointment if they wish before this stage.

Any patients who agree to take part would be free to withdraw from the study at any time, without any implications for their ongoing medical treatment. Patients do not have to give a reason as to why they would like to stop taking part, this is explained during the consent process but will be reiterated to participants during the study.

Once participants have entered the study, they would be selected at random to one of two groups:

Group 1: (Rapid Mobilisation Group) Participants will be seen between 4 and 6 hours after returning to the ward after surgery. The physiotherapist would aim to start walking with them at this stage, as long as the physiotherapist feels that this is safe.

Group 2: (Control Group) Participants will be seen between 4 and 6 hours after returning to the ward after surgery. The physiotherapist would start exercises on the bed with these patients. This is standard practice and is the current patient protocol at the Royal Bournemouth Hospital. The rest of their stay as a patient would continue as normal in accordance with standard care.

The following items will be measured for each patient:

1. How long they stay in hospital after their operation
2. How satisfied they were with physiotherapy.
3. Their pain levels when walking for the first time.
4. How quickly they return to independence with walking and other tasks.
5. Whether they had any medical complications after their operation.

The null hypothesis is that rapid walking following total hip replacement does not affect the amount of time patients stay in hospital, the amount of time taken to reach functional milestones such as walking or stairs, and how the patient grades their experience of physiotherapy.

The results of this research would then be analysed both at half way through data collection and at the end of data collection by the research team and the Sponsor and would be published as part of a research paper in a medical journal. This type of study design has been chosen to provide the research team with a high quality comparison between the two groups. Due to the nature of the treatment it was felt that it wasn't possible to implement any participant or clinician blinding to the methodology.

However, both groups of patients will be treated using a treatment protocol to limit any differences between group interventions.","['Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip', 'Hip Replacement, Total']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

489597,NCT05304247,2023-05-31,ESTIMATED,To assess the prevalence of black tooth stains and their relation with caries experience in the primary dentition of 3-5-year-old children.,"Tooth discoloration is frequently seen by dental practitioners and is considered an aesthetic problem. There are two types of teeth discoloration; intrinsic discoloration which is related to intrinsic factors such as congenital and inherited conditions and extrinsic discoloration which occurs due to the formation of pigments on the enamel surface (Prskalo et al., 2017).

Black stain is a specific type of external tooth discoloration. It is clinically diagnosed as dark dots on the gingival third of the tooth that may coalesce and form a complete dark line following gingival contour or can also impregnate pits, fissures, and grooves (França-Pinto et al., 2012).

Black stains are a common finding in children and are seen equally in both genders (Zyła et al., 2015). When children's smiles do not fit the esthetic criteria, it can have negative social and psychological consequences causing embarrassing situations for the child, including school bullying. Their guardians may also be affected as people could judge it as bad oral health and question the care given to these children .(Fernando Pessoa, n.d.)

The etiology of black stains is multifactorial . Chromogenic anaerobic bacteria have been considered one of the etiological factors by their production of hydrogen sulfide that interacts with iron present in saliva and forms insoluble ferric sulfate which is the main component of these pigments (Elelmi et al., 2021).

Rational:

Although black stains have been considered a protective factor against caries, they are considered a common aesthetic problem. According to the systematic review of Asokan et al., 2020, there is conflicting data on the relation between tooth stains and dental caries as some studies showed a positive association between black stains and caries and other studies showed a negative association between them, and therefore, further studies are needed to completely understand the nature, risk factors of black stains and their relation with caries experience.",['Dental Plaque'],OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The EVALHEP project aims to develop criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of the treatment based on imaging, mathematical models, and numerical simulations to assist radiologists who perform these complex procedures.","Percutaneous destruction of malignant liver tumors has been developing in routine clinical practice for around twenty years, and is performed by interventional radiologists under imaging guidance (ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), Cone-Beam CT...).

Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a percutaneous tumor destruction technique distinguished from other ablation methods by its non-thermal mechanism of action. The rationale behind IRE is that cells subjected to a powerful pulsed electric field will have their membrane irreversibly damaged and destroyed, while the surrounding extracellular matrix will be respected. This technology offers the opportunity to effectively destroy lesions that would be impossible to treat by any other method, due to their critical tumor location, close to vital structures at risk.

Although it has demonstrated its clinical efficacy over the years, with the potential to provide safe, curative treatment for patients with deep, poorly located tumors, IRE is considered a complex procedure, subject to numerous variability factors, and remains under-utilized to this day. Precise insertion of several needles (up to 6) at tumor level is required to obtain a homogeneous electric field of sufficient intensity. To date, there is no way of assessing the effectiveness of the procedure in real time, and inaccuracies in needle positioning or in treatment parameters will generate changes in the distribution of the electric field that may adversely affect treatment efficacy. What's more, it remains difficult to assess treatment efficacy on post-therapy images, the interpretation of which is subject to controversy.

The Interventional Radiology (IR) unit of the University Hospitals of Paris Seine Saint Denis (HUPSSD) has been using IRE for over 10 years as part of its clinical routine, mainly for the ablation of liver tumors, and in particular hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which is inoperable and ineligible for conventional thermo-ablation. Over the past ten years, more than 350 patients have benefited from one or more IREs for the treatment of liver tumors at HUPSSD, making the department a reference center in the field.

It has been shown that intervention with parents can reduce the number of children exposed to passive parental smoking by about 5%. The paediatrician's role is therefore to try to make parents aware of the consequences of tobacco consumption on their children's health and to encourage them to stop smoking. Minimal advice (simple, clear, written and oral information on the actors and means of helping to stop smoking) is the first step in triggering an attempt to stop smoking. The paediatrician seems to be a particularly influential actor since he intervenes at a time when parents are trying to improve their child's health. The minimum advice would have an effectiveness of 2-5% on smoking cessation in general. There is no data on the impact of this minimum advice when given by paediatricians. There are also no data on the current prevalence of smoking in France among parents of children with various chronic diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or diabetes. It is also necessary to describe the smoking habits of parents, as children's exposure and its impact on their health depends in particular on where their parents smoke.","['Tobacco Consumption', 'Bronchiolitis']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Participants will be assigned to receive either of the four conditions, including,

* PFT only,
* PD only,
* Both the PFT and PD,
* None of the PD or PFT (controls) Researchers will compare either groups to see if there is an improvement in the nutritional status by weight gain and care giving knowledge and practices","High malnutrition and related mortality risk is common among children with cerebral palsy (CP) in most low- and middle-income countries. This is partly due to limited access to mainstream health care services worsened by the scarcity of health professionals with an extra skill in special needs care, including the ability to manage feeding difficulties common in the CP population. Families of children with CP have thus been left alone to care for their child without a clear direction on how to provide the best care including effective feeding and nutrition practices. This amplifies the relevance of caregivers in the improvement of CP child survival, and justifies the need for affordable and culturally acceptable strategies.

Training of caregivers of children with CP as lay professionals has become a cost-effective strategy to address the physical rehabilitation workforce gap in some African countries. However, the effectiveness of these strategies is not properly evaluated with regards to managing malnutrition in CP. Furthermore, caregiver-initiated strategies like the positive deviance nutrition strategy although proven effective in the management of malnutrition among typically developed children, its effectiveness in the CP child population is not clear. This study seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of caregiver led strategies i.e., the positive deviance and parent facilitator training (physical rehabilitation) strategies, to malnutrition and care-giving among children and youth with CP in eastern Uganda.

Study Objective: To determine the difference in the effectiveness of positive deviance and parent facilitator training strategies to malnutrition and caregiving among children and youth with cerebral palsy in the Iganga Mayuge and Bugweri districts.

The investigators hypothesize that prediabetic subjects receiving zinc will demonstrate a greater decrease in HbA1c and blood glucose compared to prediabetic subjects receiving placebo.

Specific Aim: Conduct a prospective, double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing the effects of 12 months of zinc supplementation (zinc gluconate 30 milligram \[mg\] per day) versus placebo on glucose homeostasis. Based upon expected effect size and power calculations, and anticipating a 20% drop-out rate, the investigators will study 200 prediabetic subjects (100 per group) using a 1:1 randomization design. HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and other measures will be obtained at 0, 6, and 12 months and will be compared between zinc supplementation and placebo groups.","Subjects: 200 prediabetic, but otherwise healthy, subjects will be recruited at the Amish Research Clinic in Lancaster, PA. Recruitment of individuals with prediabetes will be facilitated through prior measurements of HbA1c (5.7 to 6.4%), or fasting blood glucose levels (100 to 125 mg/dL) if HbA1c is unavailable for a given participant, and current prediabetes status will be confirmed during eligibility screening.

Study Design and Intervention: 200 prediabetic subjects will be randomized 1:1 to either zinc gluconate (30 mg/day by mouth) or placebo for 12 months. Zinc dose and duration were selected based on available literature to maximize glucose-lowering potential and to achieve a durable effect. Eligible subjects (prediabetic men or women 18 to 80 years old) will undergo a thorough medical history, physical examination, must be able to willingly and safely discontinue all zinc-containing vitamins/supplements for at least 2 weeks prior to protocol initiation. After eligibility is established and informed consent is obtained, measures of blood and urine zinc concentration, glucose homeostasis (i.e. fasting glucose, HbA1c, insulin levels, 2h OGTT), and serum lipids will be measured at baseline (Clinic Visit #1), 6 months after treatment (Clinic Visit #2), and at 12 months of treatment (Clinic Visit #3). Samples will be banked at all 3 time points for measures of insulin processing (P:I ratio), insulin clearance (C:I ratio), and insulin sensitivity (Matsuda Index).

* Home visit to screen for eligibility: A research nurse and an Amish community liaison will visit potential research subjects in their homes. The nurse will explain the study and obtain informed consent. If a research subject consents, the nurse will obtain a medical history and screening laboratory tests to confirm prediabetes status (HbA1c = 5.7 to 6.4%) and assess eligibility (e.g. complete blood count \[CBC\], comprehensive metabolic panel \[CMP\], TSH). Participants will be excluded if they are pregnant, currently breastfeeding, have history of severe gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, upper GI surgery, hemochromatosis, cancer, liver disease, kidney disease, inadequately treated thyroid disease, or cardiovascular disease, hemoglobin \< 12.5 g/dl (male) or \< 11 g/dl (female), are taking medications that adversely affect glucose homeostasis (e.g., corticosteroids, anti-psychotic agents), hypersensitive to zinc, use of denture adhesive containing zinc, taking vitamins or other supplements and is unwilling or cannot safely, in the opinion of the study physician, discontinue their use at least 2 week prior to protocol initiation, or any other condition that would, in the opinion of the investigator, place them at an unacceptable risk or render them unable to meet the requirements of the protocol.
* Study Drug and Randomization: Subjects will be dispensed 190 zinc gluconate 30 mg capsules or placebo at Clinic Visit #1 and will receive additional 190 tablets after 6 months when reporting for Clinic Visit #2. Participants will be instructed to take one tablet per day at least one hour before or two hours after breakfast. A matching placebo will be developed at the Applied Pharmaceutics Laboratory at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy. Enrolled subjects will be randomized (1:1) to either the zinc or placebo intervention. Clinical staff and participants will be blinded to treatment assignment. Sealed, opaque assignment envelopes will be shuffled prior to study initiation and opened sequentially by a designated member of the research team who will then deliver the correct study drug to the clinical staff.
* Clinic Visit #1 (baseline assessment): After collection of a first morning void urine sample for measurement of zinc levels, research subjects will be transported to the Amish Research Clinic after an overnight fast where heights, weights, and vital signs will be measured. Women of child-bearing age will undergo a pregnancy test. A brief medical history including mediation usage will be performed and a food frequency questionnaire will be administered to estimate dietary zinc intake. A catheter will be placed, and fasting blood samples will be obtained to assess zinc levels, blood glucose, HbA1c, circulating lipid levels (e.g. LDL, HDL, and triglycerides), ceruloplasmin (to monitor copper deficiency), and for sample banking. A 2h (75g) OGTT will also be performed as described below. Participants will be given a 6-month supply of zinc or placebo tablets and a logbook that they will complete throughout the study, which will document daily administration of the tablets as well as any reasons for missed doses. Adherence will be assessed by comparison of remaining pill count to logbook entry.
* Clinic Visit #2 (6 month assessment): At 6 months ± 1 week after initiation of study drug, subjects will return to the Amish Research Clinic to assess intervention compliance, changes in medication/vitamin usage, and potential adverse side effects. An identical medical exam and food frequency questionnaire will be administered, and women of child-bearing age will undergo another pregnancy test. First void urine and fasting blood samples will be collected for measurement of urinary and blood zinc levels, blood glucose, HbA1c, lipid levels, ceruloplasmin, CBC, CMP, and sample banking as described above. A 2h (75g) OGTT will also be performed. Pill count and participant logbook will be reviewed to assess adherence. Participants will receive 190 zinc or placebo tablets for use in the following 6 months and instructions regarding how and when to take them will be repeated.
* Clinic Vist #3 (12 month assessment): At 12 months ± 1 week after initiation of study drug, subjects will again return to the Amish Research Clinic. Clinic Visit #3 will be identical to Clinic Visit #2 with regards to sample collection, data capture, and methodological procedures. Logbooks and remaining tablets will be collected from each participant to assess intervention adherence.

Laboratory and Other Research Methods: Our research team routinely performs all of the clinical research methodologies and statistical analyses proposed in this clinical trial. We do not anticipate any problems executing this clinical trial within the time frame of the proposed grant period.

* Routine Laboratory Testing: Eligibility screening laboratory tests (HbA1c, CBC, CMP, TSH) and other testing (blood and urine zinc levels, fasting glucose, lipid profile, ceruloplasmin) will be performed through Quest Diagnostics. Urine pregnancy tests will be administered by Amish Research Clinic staff.
* Immunoassays: Insulin, proinsulin, and C-peptide levels will be measured by immunoassay by the Cytokine Core Laboratory of the Center for Innovative Biomedical Resources (CIBR) located at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. Standard kits, reagents and protocols will be used. To minimize inter-assay variation, all immunoassays will be batched and run after samples for the entire cohort have been collected.
* 2h Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: After an overnight fast, subjects will report to the Amish Research Clinic. An indwelling cannula will be placed in an arm vein for serial blood draws at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after administration of a glucose solution (75 g glucose in 237ml), ingested over 5 min.","['Prediabetic State', 'Hyperglycemia']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The participants' demographic infos and clinical story were recorded. To evaluate exercise capacity we used the symptom-limited exercise test (ETT) and six minute walking test (6DYT). We evaluate the life quality by using Short Form-36 (SF-36).

All those evaluation tests are done before and after training. Participants are randomly divided into two groups, the first group took part in interval aerobic training (AAE) while the other group was joining in continuous training (SAE) three times a week during 6 weeks. In both groups, significant changes were found in ETT, test time and 6 DYT scores after the rehabilitation program (p\<0,05). But only AAE group have important statistical values comparing to SAE group on test time and 6DYT scores. After training SAE group showed significant statistical change in every SF-36 parameter, while AAE group showing significant values except energy/fatigue. AAE group have statistically significant changes comparing to SAE group on that parameters; physical function, role limitations due to physical function, role limitations due to emotional function and general health (p\<0,05). Consequently AAE is much more tolerable comparing to SAE and AAE is considered more effective in increasing some parameters.

It has been one of unsolved issues and unmet needs in CHB management to develop an optimal combination regimen to manage multidrug resistant HBV characterized by selection of variants with two or more classes A of signature genotypic resistant mutations1-3
2. Currently adding on Adefovir(ADV) has been generally recommended in Lamivudine(LAM)- or Telbivudine(LdT)-resistant patients but little is known about the optimal management of CHB patients who developed multidrug resistance4
3. Recent report has shown that the combination of LAM plus ADV did not suppress HBV DNA effectively in CHB patients with resistance mutations to both drugs. Only 12.2% of these pts achieved virologic response(VR; HBV DNA \<60 IU/mL) at 12 months and multivariable analysis showed that LAM+ADV group and the presence of the rtA181V/T mutation were independently associated with a decreased rate of virologic response (HBV DNA \<2,000 IU/ml) at 12 months4
4. ETV has been demonstrated to be effective in patients with ADV resistance but not in patients with proven YMDD mutation. In contrast, TDF has been shown to be effective in patients with YMDD mutation but not necessarily in all patients with ADV resistance.1-3

253716,NCT04610879,2020-09-23,ACTUAL,"Rolandic epilepsy (RE) is the most common type of epilepsy. Children with RE have seizures and can often find that their learning, sleep, behaviour, self-esteem and mood are affected.

As part of standard NHS care, children diagnosed with RE may be treated with standard anti-epileptic medicines, like carbamazepine, or no medicine at all. The medicines used to treat epilepsy often slow down a child's thinking and learning. In the past, doctors believed this was an acceptable price to pay to reduce seizures. However, with RE, where the seizures usually stop in teenage years, investigators do not know if it is better to treat these children with medicines or not, especially if the medicines might have a negative effect on their learning.

A newer medicine called levetiracetam has also been found to work in children with RE and has shown less problems with thinking and learning in adults. However, it is still no known if this is also the case for children and it has not been proven which of the three options (carbamazepine, levetiracetam or no treatment) would be best for RE patients. The CASTLE study aims to find this out.

In addition, it has been found that seizures often happen when a child has had poor sleep and they often come at night or early in the morning. It has been shown that sleep can be improved through practice without the need of medicines. There are established guidelines to help toddlers go to sleep, but nothing available that helps young people with epilepsy and their parents improve their sleep quality. In the CASTLE study, a sleep training plan has been developed for children with epilepsy and the trial aims to find out whether following this sleep training plan results in less seizures than using no sleep training at all.","The trial is a phase IV randomised factorial design controlled trial comparing carbamazepine, levetiracetam or active monitoring combined with or without sleep behaviour intervention. A factorial trial design has been used as this approach enables the efficient simultaneous investigation of AED (carbamazepine; levetiracetam; no AED) and sleep behaviour intervention (vs standard care) by including all participants in both analyses. In a factorial trial it is also possible to consider both the separate effects of each intervention and the benefits of receiving both interventions together (for example levetiracetam and sleep intervention).

The CASTLE trial will take place in NHS out-patient paediatric epilepsy and general paediatric clinics in the United Kingdom (UK).

Once consent has been obtained from the appropriate adult, and assent from the child if appropriate, by the delegated member of the research team the eligibility assessments will be completed, full eligibility confirmed (confirmation must be by a medically qualified doctor) and baseline data will be collected prior to randomisation.

Randomisation will be performed via a web based tool accessed by research team at site. This system is generated centrally by the Clinical Trial Research Centre (CTRC) using a computer algorithm concealed from the investigators and research teams/trial management group. In order to balance the groups, minimisation for variables believed to influence disease outcome and end points will be built into the randomisation algorithm.

Participants will be randomised to treatment with carbamazepine, levetiracetam or active monitoring. Where randomised to drug treatment, the randomised treatment should ideally begin on the day of randomisation or within 14 days of randomisation at the latest. Randomised treatment will continue for a minimum of 12 months and a maximum of 48 months. All treatments will be procured, prescribed and issued as per routine NHS practice.

Clinical data capture will be in the form of paper copies of Case Report Forms (CRFs) that will be returned as an on-going process from each centre to the CTRC.

* To determine the specific tumor marker response (CEA and CA19-9) to neoadjuvant therapy.
* To determine the prognostic accuracy of serum protein profiles in these patients.
* To determine the overall survival and patterns of tumor recurrence (local vs distant).

274201,NCT00877838,2010-12,ESTIMATED,The following study is being conducted to explore the safety and effectiveness of a new chemical entity called NXN-188 in subjects with a history of migraine with aura. In this study subjects will treat two attacks of migraine with aura during the aura phase - once with placebo and once with NXN-188.,"The purpose of this study is to examine a new chemical entity with 5HT agonist activity and an inhibition of the nitric oxide synthase enzyme (NOS) in patients suffering from migraine with aura. Nitric oxide has diverse roles both in normal and pathological processes including the regulation of blood pressure, neurotransmission, and macrophage defense systems. NO is synthesized by three isoforms of the NOS enzyme: neuronal (n), inducible (i) and endothelial (e). Neuronal NOS (nNOS) is found mainly in neuronal tissue and regulates changes in response sensitivity and cellular plasticity; iNOS is found in macrophages and other tissue, produces NO in response to stress and injury and is one source of inflammation; eNOS is found in endothelial cells, responsible for vascular homeostasis and the presumed mechanism for the effects of nitroglycerine therapy in angina; nitroglycerine is an NO donor. NXN-188 is selectively inhibits nNOS.

There is ample scientific and clinical evidence that NO is involved in the pathogenesis of migraine pain, as well as other pain states characterized by central sensitization (e.g., neuropathic pain). NO donors such as trinitroglycerine induce headache followed by migraine in migraineurs with or without aura ; moreover, platelet nitrates (a signal for increased NO) increase before and during a migraine attack. In addition, increasing NO levels can enhance pain responses in animals, including allodynia in rats; NO is a component of several pathways where pain systems converge in the PNS and CNS and regulates the activity of numerous transmitter systems ; NO is involved in central sensitization particularly those involving NMDA and calcium channels and thought to be a major component of the formation of neuropathic pain states Non-specific NOS inhibitors have been reported to relieve migraine and chronic tension type headaches in human studies. In animals, NOS inhibitors reduce pain-related behaviors in multiple neuropathic pain models and spinal cord ischemia as well as reducing pain related behaviors in chemically-induced pain models, particularly in secondary pain states.

The development of central sensitization in the course of a migraine attack suggests a role for the neuronal isoform of the NOS enzyme.

NXN-188 can bind to both 5-HT1D and 5-HT1B receptors with potency similar to sumatriptan; it also selectively binds to nNOS with a level of nNOS inhibition similar to L-NMMA. NXN-188 is devoid of any relevant eNOS inhibition in in vitro cloned human enzyme assays or ex vivo in human coronary arteries and is expected to be effective in treating migraine by inhibition of the nNOS enzyme without vasoconstrictive effects associated with non-selective compounds such as L-NMMA.

Only 3% of these manifestations are neurological diseases, but they have serious consequences for the patient's health, and often constitute a significant diagnostic problem. Neurological symptoms may precede the appearance of IBD symptoms by up to several years. According to the available literature, symptoms of neurological diseases are more common in men and are usually diagnosed after the diagnosis of IBD, but they are rarely associated with exacerbations of the disease. The most common of these are demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. The very application of treatment in patients with IBD may also play an important role in the development of neurological diseases of various types and pathogenesis. The use of immunosuppressants and therapy with biological drugs may lead to the impairment of the central nervous system due to changes in the white matter of the brain, a predisposition to opportunistic infections, John Cunningham virus infections and the resulting progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). So far, the literature describes the occurrence of many neurological diseases in patients with coexisting IBD, caused by side effects of the treatment itself, cerebral vascular diseases or caused by immune disorders. Cases of Wernicke encephalopathy caused by vitamin B1 deficiency have also been reported. A broad term that defines symptoms of not only neurological diseases is encephalopathy. By definition, it means damage or disease that affects the brain. It occurs when the way the brain works is changed due to a change in the body. These changes cause changes in the psyche, causing confusion and a change in typical behavior. Encephalopathy is not a single disease entity but a disorder with complex pathophysiology. It is a serious disease that, if untreated (or rather its underlying cause), leads to permanent brain damage. Due to the variety of symptoms and their variable severity, the diagnosis of encephalopathy often escapes the team of chronically ill patients. Patients with IBD are such a group - young patients whose severe, incurable disease changes their philosophy of life. The influence of IBD on encephalopathy symptoms has not been evaluated so far. This study is designed to answer the question of whether encephalopathy occurs in people with IBD. By extrapolating the incidence of encephalopathy in people with another immunologically mediated disease, Hashimoto's disease, we hypothesized that such a disorder could also occur in people with IBD. We assume that autoimmune mechanisms underlying the disease will contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the phenomenon, similarly to thyroid disease. Additionally, with increasing incidence in the scientific literature, it is stated that in about 30% of cases, IBD symptoms overlap with functional bowel diseases such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), so we plan, in the questionnaire presented to patients, to include questions regarding the coexistence of these disorder as described in the Roman IV Criteria.",,"['Inflammatory Bowel Diseases', 'Ulcerative Colitis Chronic', 'Crohn Disease', 'Irritable Bowel Syndrome', 'Encephalopathy']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

113203,NCT02132026,2019-11-28,ACTUAL,"Aortic stenosis is a condition whereby one of the heart valves (aortic valve) becomes narrowed, due to calcium deposition, over time. This can lead to chest pain, heart failure and sudden death. It is the commonest valve disease requiring surgery in the developed world and as the population becomes increasingly older, it is predicted that the prevalence of aortic stenosis will double in the next 20 years. Currently the only treatment is replacement of the aortic valve. Whilst this is excellent treatment, not everyone is suitable for it.

The primary objective of our study is to determine whether 2 drugs used in the treatment of osteoporosis (a condition of bone thinning) can halt/retard the progression of aortic stenosis. This is on the basis that studies have suggested that altered regulation of calcium metabolism may be an important mechanism perpetuating the disease. Both drugs work by reducing calcium release into the bloodstream from bones and therefore calcification of the aortic valve.

150 patients will therefore be randomly allocated to either of the trial drugs which are denosumab,the bisphosphonate (alendronic acid), or a placebo.

Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanning is a technique where biochemically active molecules are injected and are taken up at sites of ongoing calcification activity where they emit radiation and can be detected by the PET scanner. We have previously shown that this technique can demonstrate areas of newly developing calcification on an aortic valve.

We therefore propose that patients receiving bisphosphonates or denosumab will have reduced evidence of active calcification and slower progression of their disease at two years as assessed by Echocardiography (ultrasound) and a change in their calcium score (quantity of calcium on the aortic valve measured using Computed Tomography \[CT\] ).

The data from this study will then be used to design a larger trial.","BACKGROUND Aortic Stenosis is a common cause of valvular heart disease in which the valve cusps become progressively calcified. The only available treatment is aortic valve replacement and previous attempts at providing medical therapies to modify the disease process have proved unsuccessful.

Pathophysiology of Aortic Stenosis. The initiating event is believed to be caused by mechanical damage to the cells lining the valve in a process similar to that which occurs in atherosclerosis. However the propagating mechanism is more likely to be that of active calcification. In support of this, a growing body of pre-clinical and clinical data indicates that treatments for osteoporosis, which work by preventing the breakdown of bone and therefore calcium release into the blood, can reduce calcium deposition (calcification) of the blood vessels. These agents therefore hold considerable promise as novel therapies for aortic stenosis.

Denosumab in Aortic Stenosis Denosumab is a drug which prevents bone cells called osteoclasts from breaking down bone and releasing calcium into the blood. For this reason it is used to treat osteoporosis. It works on a specific pathway which we believe to be important in regulating calcium release from bone. Mice engineered with defects within this pathway were found to have increased bone breakdown and blood vessel calcification. Furthermore there have been two studies to assess the role of this pathway in patients with aortic valve disease. Both studies have also demonstrated altered regulation within this pathway

Bisphosphonates in Aortic Stenosis Bisphosphonates are a group of drugs widely used for the treatment of osteoporosis and also prevent bone breakdown by osteoclasts. They have also been shown to have important cardiovascular effects with a consistent reduction in calcification of blood vessels and the aortic valve. This in part appears to be a consequence of their inhibition of bone breakdown but also by reducing the production of key inflammatory substances implicated in the early stages of aortic stenosis. We plan on using alendronic acid which is a bisphosphonate commonly used in the management of osteoporosis.

PET CT scanning in Aortic Stenosis. 18F-NaF (Sodium Fluoride) is biochemical compound which preferentially binds to regions of newly developing calcification and emits radiation. When used in combination with Computed Tomography (CT) it enables it to be localized. This way we are able to identify areas of newly developing calcification on an aortic valve.

In previous studies in our institution, we demonstrated we could quantify 18F-NaF uptake in the aortic valve and that there was a progressive rise in activity with increasing disease severity. We found that at At 1 year, the baseline 18F-NaF uptake emerged as a powerful predictor of the progression in aortic valve calcification. Following analysis of 2 year follow up data, 18F-NaF emerged as an independent predictor of aortic valve replacement and cardiovascular mortality

Therefore these findings have led us to propose that

1. Calcification is the key driver to Aortic Stenosis Progression
2. We want to reduce calcification activity using Denosumab and Biphosphonates
3. We predict that this will reduce the 18F-NaF signal and disease progression on Echocardiography and CT.

STUDY DESIGN This will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-control trial of denosumab and alendronic acid in patients with aortic stenosis.

Study population and randomization

We aim to recruit 170 patients in total with non-rheumatic calcific aortic stenosis.

20 patients will only participate in scan-rescan reproducibility studies. They will not proceed to the randomization stage.

Of the remaining 150 patients, 75 subjects will be randomized (2:1) to either subcutaneous denosumab 60 mg (n=50) or matched placebo (n=25) every 6 months; and a further 75 will be randomized (2:1) to oral alendronate 70 mg (n=50) or matched placebo (n=25) once weekly

Assessment and follow up

All subjects will undergo a standardized clinical assessment at baseline and every six months. Data will be collected with respect to symptomatic status, the trial safety endpoints, routine biochemical profiling, biomarkers, quality of life questionnaires and electrocardiography.

Aortic stenosis severity will be assessed at baseline and every 6 months by echocardiography performed by a single, dedicated sonographer to maximize reproducibility. Severity will be assessed using the peak and mean aortic valve pressure gradients (this technique is used to monitor aortic stenosis severity; the higher the pressure gradient across the aortic valve the more severe the narrowing). We will also calculate the aortic valve area and calcification score.

PET CT and CT calcium scoring.

Both will be performed using a combined PET and 128-multidetector CT scanner (Biograph 128, Siemens).

CT calcium scoring measures the amount of calcium in the valve and will be assessed at baseline, 6 months and 2 years. It will act as an additional marker of disease severity and progression alongside Echocardiography. Those with a heart rate of \>65 /min will be given heart-slowing medication (beta blockers) if deemed safe. The region of the aortic valve will be then be scanned during a breath hold.

18F-NaF PET uptake will be measured at baseline, and 6 months to assess the early impact of the intervention on valvular calcification activity. PET images on their own are difficult to interpret as they do not tell you where the radiation is coming from. For this reason the PET needs to be performed alongside CT which gives us images of the aortic valve. By superimposing the two images we are able to identify where the 'PET signal' is originating from.

To ensure optimal image quality patients will be required to adhere to a high fat, low carbohydrate diet for 48 hours prior to the scan. The subject will then be cannulated to enable injection of the 18F-NaF tracer. They will then rest in a quiet environment for 60 minutes to enable the tracer to reach the valve before transfer to the imaging suite. Those with a heart rate of \>65 /min will be given beta-blockade if it is deemed suitable and safe. This is routine practice in cardiac CT. A scout CT will be performed to allow optimal alignment of the PET and CT scanners (so we can be sure the radiation we are detecting is coming from the aortic valve). The patient will then be asked to lie still for 30 minutes so that the PET data can be acquired.

Finally a 'CT angiogram' will be performed of the aortic valve. This involves image acquisition following injection of a radio opaque dye into the aorta. This again allows more accurate localization of our PET signal.

The additional twenty patients will only undergo repeat PET/CT imaging within 2 weeks of their baseline scan to investigate scan-rescan reproducibility of the 18F-NaF PET signal. They will not proceed with the trial beyond this stage to avoid facing increased radiation exposure.",['Calcific Aortic Stenosis'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The estimated incidence is 1 per 12000 newborns. Although homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the genes IPF1 or GCK were the first genetic causes of this disease to be identified, activating mutations in the KIR6.2 and sulfonylurea receptor 1 (SUR1) subunits of the pancreatic ATP-sensitive K+ channel, coded for by the genes KCNJ11 and ABCC8, have recently been identified as the major causes of both transient and permanent neonatal diabetes. In the normal pancreatic beta-cell, metabolism results in increased cellular ATP, which binds to KIR6.2. The potassium channel subsequently closes and hence depolarizes the membrane initiating insulin release via increased calcium entry. Conversely, increased cellular ADP acts on SUR1 to open the channel and prevent insulin release. Activating mutations in these channels reduces sensitivity to the inhibitory actions of ATP and increases sensitivity to the stimulatory actions of ADP. This causes the ATP-sensitive K+ channel to remain open, even in the presence of glucose, therefore preventing insulin release. Sulfonylureas act by an ATP-independent mechanism to close these channels even when mutations are present. Sulfonylureas result in insulin release and were therefore immediately considered and showed to be a potential treatment option in neonatal diabetes caused by mutations in these channels. The effective replacement of insulin treatment by high-dose sulfonylureas has been shown to be successful in 90% of patients with Kir6.2 mutations and 85% of patients with SUR1 mutations resulting in improved glycemic control.

This dramatic effect of sulfonylurea is now standard, world-wide treatment in neonatal diabetes due to a mutation in either KCNJ11 or ABCC8. There is, however, far no information on long-term use of sulfonylurea in patients with KCNJ11 or ABCC8 mutations. The investigators have therefore initiated an international, multicenter, prospective study aiming to include some 75 patients aged from 9 years with a genetic diagnosis of diabetes due to a ABCC8 gene mutation identified by sequencing in Bergen, Norway; Exeter, U.K.; Paris, France or Rome, Italy. Most patients were referred based on membership in the International Society of Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes. All of the patients attempted transfer from treatment with insulin to a sufficient dose of sulfonylureas. No other selection criteria were applied, and all patients were included when there was outcome data following the attempted transfer.

490009,NCT05114447,2023-06,ESTIMATED,"Within the AGAVE project (2010-2014), funded by the 2008 AIFA (Italian Medicines Agency) Call (contract No. FARM8YRYZC), a severe/uncontrolled asthma online Registry (RItA) was implemented to assess the appropriateness of therapeutic strategies for severe/uncontrolled asthma patients, according to GINA (Global Initiative for Asthma) guidelines, in epidemiological and clinical samples. The online RItA Registry is a database containing information on patients' general characteristics, medical history, clinical data, risk factors, comorbidity, asthma exacerbations, current asthma treatment. Currently, it contains information on severe/uncontrolled asthma subjects, enrolled at national level, performing baseline (n tot=1018) and follow-up interviews (n tot=402).

Aim of the RISER study is to increase knowledge about the risk factors, diagnosis, and management of severe/uncontrolled asthma in general population and clinical setting through the update and follow-up of the RItA registry.

The RISER study is an observational longitudinal study involving a clinical setting and an epidemiological one.

The field survey will comprise one or two follow-ups according to the sample.

1. Observational longitudinal study in hospital specialist centres (clinical sample). Clinical cases of severe/uncontrolled asthma already included in the online RItA Registry and new clinical cases of severe/uncontrolled asthma attending the clinical centres and not yet included in the online RItA Registry, will be investigated at T0, T6 and T12 through a clinical form in order to collect information in accordance with the online RItA registry, and routine clinical/functional tests of asthma control.
2. Observational longitudinal study in a general population sample (epidemiological sample). Epidemiological cases of severe/uncontrolled asthma from Pisa cohort already inserted in the online RItA Registry and new epidemiological cases of severe/uncontrolled asthma from pre-existing Pisa cohort not yet included in the online RItA Registry will be investigated at T0 and T12 through a questionnaire to collect information for feeding the online RItA registry. Subjects fitting the epidemiological definition of severe/uncontrolled asthma will be invited at the Pisa clinical centre to have routine clinical/functional tests.

All data collected from clinical/epidemiological centres will be included in the RItA registry.

Overall, it is expected to enroll 422 patients.","RISER study is an observational longitudinal study in epidemiological and clinical samples investigated through questionnaires/clinical forms and routine clinical/functional assessments at baseline and at follow-ups.

The study is constituted by two arms:

1. observational longitudinal study in hospital specialist centres (clinical sample);
2. observational longitudinal study in a general population sample (epidemiological sample).

The clinical sample will provide a new characterization of severe/uncontrolled asthma phenotypes through clinical and functional assessments and biomarkers.

The epidemiological sample will allow to obtain new information about risk/protective factors for severe/uncontrolled asthma and to identify new cases who have not been yet referred to clinical centres.

RISER study is not a clinical trial, but it is an observational study without any specific drug administration by the investigators. Participants will receive interventions, which can include medical products, such as drugs or devices, or procedures, as part of their routine medical care, but they will not be assigned to specific interventions by the investigator as in a clinical trial.

Sample size Considering a possible loss to follow-up and a refusal rate of 20%, the expected number of subjects in the clinical sample will be 287 (195 cases already included in the online RItA Registry and 92 new uncontrolled/severe asthma cases not yet included in the Registry).

Considering a possible loss to follow-up and a refusal rate of 30%, the expected number of subjects in the epidemiological sample will be 135 (112 cases already included in the online RItA Registry and 23 new uncontrolled/severe asthma cases not yet included in the Registry).

Data collection tools:

1. Clinical form (clinical sample): a modified and updated version of the RItA Registry implemented during the AGAVE study will be used;
2. Questionnaire (epidemiological sample): a modified and updated version of the questionnaire implemented during the AGAVE study will be used. The questionnaire will be structured according to the data required by the online RItA registry.

   The clinical form and the questionnaire will take into account the following aspects, as in the pre-existing RItA Registry: demographic characteristics, asthma severity and level of control, current asthma therapy, comorbidities, risk factors, health services utilization.

   New information, to answer to new specific aspects addressed in the RISER study, will be integrated: asthma indirect costs, quality of life, biological drugs use, reason of changing therapy, use of electronic cigarettes or of heat-not-burn tobacco.
3. Routine clinical /functional tests of asthma control (clinical and epidemiological sample):

serum total IgE, spirometry, reversibility test, blood cell count, fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), oscillometry.

Data collected from clinical and epidemiological centres will be included in the online RiTA registry.

Field survey The field survey will be organized in three or two phases, according to the type of sample. In particular, the field study will comprise T0, baseline, T6, follow-up at 6 months from baseline (only for the clinical sample), T12, follow-up at 12 months from baseline.

1. Observational longitudinal study in hospital specialist centres (clinical sample): eligible subjects will be contacted from physicians, by telephone or directly when they attend the clinical centre for control visits. Once the patients have provided their signed informed consent, they will have to fill in the clinical form; routine functional/clinical tests will be performed. In particular, subjects will be investigated at T0, T6 and T12 through the clinical form in order to collect information in accordance with the online RItA Registry and routine clinical/functional tests of asthma control.

   All the possible variations that could occur in the patients' disease status and disease management, according to the routine medical care, will be registered and taken into account in the RISER study.
2. Observational longitudinal study in a general population sample (epidemiological sample): eligible subjects will be contacted by telephone from trained personnel of the Research Unit.

Once the signed informed consent is obtained by each enrolled subject, they will be invited to answer the phone questionnaire and to perform a medical examination at the local clinical centre.

In particular, subjects will be investigated at T0 and T12 through the questionnaire to collect information for feeding the online RItA Registry. Subjects fitting the epidemiological definition of severe/uncontrolled asthma will be invited at the Pisa clinical centre (CC) to have routine clinical/functional tests.

Each subject performing baseline clinical/functional tests at the Pisa clinical centre (CC) will be clinically and functionally re-assessed.

. Statistical analysis: data quality control will be carried out before statistical analysis performance.

Descriptive analysis will comprise: frequency distribution and Chi-square test for categorical variables; analysis of variance and Wilcoxon's rank test for continuous variables.

Multivariable analysis will be carried out through logistic regression analysis and survival analysis, taking into account the independent effects of potential confounders. Analyses to assess asthma phenotypes/endotypes and presence of risk factors clusters will be performed (i.e. cluster analysis, network analysis, principal component analysis) as well.

Analysis on cross-sectional and longitudinal data will be carried out. The longitudinal analysis will take into account a follow-up period of 6 and 12 months. For subjects already included in the online RItA Registry, a longer follow-up will be assessed (from 5 to 9 years).

Comparisons between the different phases of the study will permit to collect information about changes in asthma condition; in particular, the following statistical analysis will be carried out:

1. assessment of incidence and prevalence of severe/uncontrolled asthma and related risk factors in asthmatic cohorts;
2. comparison between different therapeutic approaches and related effectiveness in terms of asthma control, in the whole sample and taking into account comorbidity and polypharmacy;
3. assessment of possible risk factors for severe/uncontrolled asthma (i.e. demographic characteristics, environmental/occupational exposure, comorbidity) related to a different effectiveness of the therapeutic approach;
4. assessment of treatable traits related to different effectiveness of the therapeutic approach;
5. assessment of severe/uncontrolled asthma average indirect costs, in the whole sample and in specific subgroups of patients, in relation to gender, age, environmental exposures, comorbidity;
6. assessment of risk factors (i.e. demographic characteristics, environmental/occupational exposure, comorbidity) related to different disease prognosis;
7. characterization of specialist clinical setting and epidemiological setting in terms of risk factors exposure, therapeutic approaches and asthma control;
8. assessment of characteristics of new cases, enrolled from the epidemiological cohort and clinically confirmed, who have not been yet referred to clinical centres.

Ethical aspects: No issue about the safety of the protocol has to be forecasted, since all the protocol procedures are routine analyses for severe/uncontrolled asthma patients.

Study subjects will not undergo any risk for their physical or psychological domains, as they will perform questionnaire interview and a regular medical examination under safe procedures.

According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR 25 May 2018), informed consent for data collection and analysis will be requested to the subjects involved in the study.","['Asthma', 'Asthma Severe Persistent Uncontrolled']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria

494417,NCT05377853,2024-02,ESTIMATED,"One of the most challenging tasks for blind and visually impaired individuals is navigation through a complex environment. The goal of the present multidisciplinary study is to increase spatial-cognition abilities in people who are blind or visually impaired through training with the previously-developed Cognitive-Kinesthetic Rehabilitation Training to improve navigation, and to investigate the resultant neuroplastic brain reorganization through multimodal brain imaging.

In accordance with National Eye Institute (NEI) strategic goals, this multidisciplinary project will promote the development of well-informed new approaches to navigational rehabilitation, memory enhancement and cross-modal brain plasticity to benefit 'cutting edge' fields of mobile assistive technologies, vision restoration and memory facilitation for the aging brain.","The investigators propose a radical new multidisciplinary approach to navigation training in blindness and visual impairment. Successful navigation requires the development of an accurate and flexible mental, or cognitive, map of the navigational space and of the route trajectory required to travel from the current to the target location. The Cognitive-Kinesthetic (C-K) Rehabilitation Training that the PI has developed in the preceding period utilizes a unique form of blind memory-guided drawing to develop cognitive mapping to a high level of proficiency. Particular reliance must be placed on such mental maps (supported only by tactile and auditory inputs), and on the ability to use them effectively for spatiomotor control, when vision with its built-in spatial functionality is lost. There is, however, a fundamental gap in the practice of Orientation and Mobility (O\&M), which is the lack of a specific emphasis on enhancement of these cognitive roots of spatiomotor activity, despite their known importance for navigation in the visually impaired.

The investigators therefore propose a rigorous multidisciplinary approach to this issue, which lies at the intersection of the fields of spatiomotor rehabilitation, blindness assessment technologies, and brain function, each a focus of one Specific Aim. To train the spatial cognition abilities underlying successful navigation, the current proposal aims to translate the power of the C-K Rehabilitation Training to the domain of navigation. The blind and visually impaired trainees will quickly learn how to generate precise and stable cognitive maps of haptically explored raised-line images or tactile maps, and how to use the formed cognitive maps to confidently guide both drawing 'hand navigation' on a map-scale, and whole-body blind navigation on the macro-scale. Once translated to navigation, the preliminary data show that this efficient and enjoyable training will rapidly and sustainably enhance spatial cognition functions both for improved navigation performance and for enhancement of more general spatial cognitive skills. Beyond its practical advantages, the rapid and effective training protocol will also serve as an efficient tool to drive and study training-based neuroplasticity mechanisms through a comprehensive whole-brain multimodal brain imaging platform.","['Blindness', 'Blindness, Acquired', 'Low Vision', 'Blindness, Complete']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Echocardiography is a non-invasive (does not break the skin) procedure used to see an image of the heart. It uses harmless sound waves to create an image of the heart on a computer screen. These images will show the valves of the heart, how well the heart is pumping blood, the blood flow across these valves and how large the heart is. A silver paddle-shaped device is moved easily over the skin to capture these images.

Calcification (hardening) of the heart valves and heart rings (fibrous tissue surrounding the valves) is a common finding and it increases with age. The presence of calcification changes the blood flow through the heart valves.

Background This study focuses on the application of laser ablation in the treatment of cervical HSIL, explores the efficacy, feasibility, and safety of laser ablation in the treatment of cervical HSIL, and strives to promote the reasonable application of laser ablation in the treatment of cervical HSIL.
2. Research objects Young patients with cervical HSIL underwent colposcopic evaluation, completed cervical biopsy, and were pathologically confirmed to be eligible for ablation.
3. Methods 3.1 Sample size This study was a randomized controlled trial with parallel design. HSIL recurrence rate was the primary endpoint. According to previous literature reports, it is estimated that the recurrence rate of HSIL in the laser treatment group is 15%. The recurrence rate of HSIL in the resection group was 5%. Let α=0.05 (both sides), hold =0.80. Using PASS 11 software, the sample size of both groups was 138 cases. Assuming that the loss of follow-up rate of the study subjects was 10%, the sample size of each group was 138÷0.9=154 cases. Therefore, 308 patients were intended to be included in the study.

   3.2 Statistical methods SPSS 24.0 software will be used for statistical analysis of all data. Measurement data with normal distribution will be described by mean ± standard deviation. Independent sample t-test or rank sum test will be used for inter-group comparison, and paired sample t-test will be used for intra-group comparison before and after treatment. Counting data will be expressed as examples or percentages (%), and the Chi-square test will be used for comparison between groups.

Chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathies (CIPN) are primarily sensory impairments that can alter the signals for somatosensory feedback and thus affect the postural control in the standing position. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of chemotherapy and peripheral neuropathies on postural control in the standing position. As balance maintenance is a complex construct involving different systems, this study will evaluate maintenance strategies during sensory disturbances in order to better understand post-chemotherapy coping strategies. These sensory disturbances concern vision (eyes closed) and the alteration of the somatosensory system (foam under the feet and vibration system). In addition, this study will evaluate balance in double task situations and dynamic stability. Given the consequent impact of chemotherapy and peripheral neuropathies on quality of life, a quality of life questionnaire will also be administered.","['Cancer, Breast', 'Cancer, Gynecologic']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Participants will randomly be assigned to conditions. Participants will be tested in pairs. The participant in the player condition will play a video game while the participant in the watcher condition will watch. The participants will be in the same room, seated next to each other.

Video games will be chosen for the three conditions which have no violent content (nonviolent condition), violent content with a sword as a weapon for the player (violent with sword condition), and violent content with a gun as a weapon (violent with gun condition). All games chosen will be age appropriate (rated E) and have a consistent perspective (i.e., 1st person or 3rd person) between conditions. Participants will be asked how familiar they are with the video game used to control for experience with the stimulus. Gameplay will last for 20 minutes.

The measures for experiment 3 will include the media habits, aggressive behavior, attitude toward guns, and guns in the home measures listed for experiment 1. In addition, parents will be asked if their children have taken a gun safety course and a behavioral measure will be whether or not children handle a real (but non-firing) gun and whether they pull the trigger.

Although weight control research has significantly improved short-term treatment success, long-term weight loss maintenance has lagged behind. Research has demonstrated a consistent relationship between self-monitoring eating and physical activity habits and success in weight loss as well as in maintenance of weight loss. However, the methods primarily used for self-monitoring continue to be the paper diary (PD), which is time consuming and burdensome. Moreover, PDs do not permit immediate external feedback to support and motivate the individual. Emerging technologies could improve self-monitoring and weight loss treatment.

And the occurrence of acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of chronic kidney disease. Intraoperative hypotension is identified as an important risk factor of postoperative acute kidney injury. Preliminary studies showed that goal-directed hemodynamic management may reduce kidney injury after surgery but requires further demonstration. We hypothesized that goal-directed hemodynamic management combining hydration, inotropes, and forced diuresis to maintain pulse pressure variation \<9%, mean arterial pressure ≥85 mmHg, and urine flow rate \>200 ml/h (3ml/kg/h) may reduce the incidence of acute kidney injury and improve long-term renal outcome after radical nephrectomy. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of goal-directed hemodynamic management on the occurrence of acute and persistent kidney injury in patients following radical nephrectomy.","Renal cancer accounts for 20.3% of urinary system tumors, and the incidence is still increasing. Surgical resection is the main treatment of renal cancer; radical nephrectomy is the standard operation for renal cancer of stage T2 or above. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after radical nephrectomy, with an incidence of up to 53.9%. AKI is associated with the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is an independent risk factor of new onset CKD in patients without underlying kidney disease. A meta-analysis showed that, at one year after surgery, patients with AKI had a 2.7-fold increased risk of new onset or progression of CKD and a 4.8-fold increased risk of end-stage renal disease. Moreover, even mild AKI is associated with renal insufficiency at 1 to 2 years after surgery.

Taking active measures to reduce the incidence of AKI may improve long-term renal function after radical nephrectomy. Many clinical studies show that intraoperative hypotension is an important risk factor of postoperative kidney injury. For example, a study found that intraoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) \<65 mmHg or a decrease of more than 20% from baseline was associated with an increased risk of postoperative AKI; the risk of AKI increased alone with prolonged duration of hypotension. However, recent randomized controlled trials showed inconsistent results regarding the effect of tight blood pressure management strategy on kidney outcome. Relevant studies indicated that hydration with forced diuresis and inotropes to maintain cardiac output and blood pressure might improve renal outcome.

In a previous pilot trial of the authors, goal-directed hemodynamic management combining hydrationa and inotropics reduced the incidence of AKI by about 40% in patients following partial nephrectomy. However, the difference was not statistically significant due to insufficient sample size. The purpose of this trial is to investigate whether goal-directed intraoperative hemodynamic management combining hydration, inotropics, and forced diuresis can reduce the occurrence of acute and persistent kidney injury in patients undergoing radical nephrectomy.","['Renal Cell Carcinoma', 'Nephrectomy', 'Hemodynamic Management', 'Acute Kidney Injury', 'Chronic Kidney Diseases']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion criteria:

353042,NCT01876082,2019-09,ACTUAL,"Desmoids tumors are benign soft tissues tumors characterized by aggressiveness and potential local recurrence. There is a female predominance with a sex ratio of 2/1 and median age at diagnosis is about 30 years.

Only a complete surgical excision is recommended in desmoids tumors. Some forms of desmoid tumors are recurrent and/or symptomatic and are not accessible to a conservative surgical treatment. In these clinical situations, only a medical treatment may achieve tumor control and quality of life maintenance. Place of systemic treatments in the management of desmoids tumors is poorly evaluated. Regarding chemotherapy, methotrexate and vinblastine protocol is actually the best evaluated combination, which allowed observing objective response rate between 40 and 75%. Toxicity was mainly marked by the risk of haematological toxicity.

Pazopanib is an inhibitor of multi-target tyrosine kinase, in oral form, with selective type receptors -1, -2 and -3 of VEGF receptors on the PDGFA and B, and c-Kit. It is currently under clinical development in humans in the treatment of several tumor types.","This is a Phase II, randomized, multicenter, open label trial, evaluating efficacy and safety of pazopanib versus a chemotherapy protocol combining methotrexate and vinblastine in progressive and symptomatic desmoid tumors.

431161,NCT01116375,2014-09,ACTUAL,"To determine whether, in obese children with moderate-severe Obstructive Sleep Apnea who are prescribed Positive Airway Pressure(PAP) therapy, increased hours of PAP usage per night over a one-year period is associated with a greater improvement in HOMA-IR","Rationale: The five-fold increase in prevalence of childhood obesity in Canada over the last 15 years has led to an increasing number of pediatric cases of obesity-related obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Not only is the prevalence of OSA significantly higher among obese children compared with the general population, but in this group, routine treatment by adenotonsillectomy has a much lower cure rate. Instead, Positive Airway Pressure (PAP) treatment is usually prescribed. Other complications of obesity are also increasingly recognized in children, including metabolic disturbances with insulin resistance (IR). This is particularly concerning, since IR is an identified surrogate measure of future obesity-related sequelae, such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease (including hypertension, and heart rate disturbances), inflammation and impaired quality of life. Of particular interest, the IR related to obesity can be exacerbated by OSA and the severity of IR correlates with the severity of OSA. IR is measured using a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and is calculated from fasting blood glucose and insulin levels. In obese adults with OSA, HOMA-IR, as well as cardiovascular and other metabolic markers, has been shown to improve following PAP therapy. Such a study has not been done in children. We hypothesize that PAP treatment for obese children with moderate-severe OSA will improve markers of obesity-related disease.

Primary Objective: To determine whether, in obese children with moderate-severe OSA who are prescribed PAP therapy, increased hours of PAP usage per night over a one-year period is associated with a greater improvement in HOMA-IR. Secondary Objectives: To determine whether increased hours of PAP usage per night is associated with a greater improvement in the following outcomes: 1) sympathetic nervous system activation (systolic and diastolic hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, heart rate and heart rate variability); 2) inflammation 3) neurobehavioral and quality of life measures. Methods: Study design: prospective multi-centre cohort study. Study Population: Obese children (body mass index (BMI) ≥ 95th %ile for age and sex) 8-17 years old with moderate-severe OSA will be recruited for this study from four pediatric tertiary care centres across Canada. As per current standard of care, those children with moderate-severe OSA, defined as ≥ 10 obstructive events per hour on polysomnography, will be prescribed PAP treatment. Sample Size: We expect a medium effect size (0.5); therefore 10 subjects per parameter tested (n=4) in the regression model and 25% attrition requires the recruitment of 54 subjects. Measurements will be made at baseline and 12 months. Data collection will include HOMA-IR, 24-hr blood pressure measurements, electrocardiogram for heart rate and heart rate variability, C-reactive protein as a marker of inflammation, neurobehavioral/quality of life measures (Conners parent and teacher scales, Child Behavior Checklist and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory) and physical activity questionnaire (Habitual Activity Estimation Scale (HAES)). Data Analysis: Multivariate linear regression analyses will be performed for our primary and secondary outcomes. Our dependent variable will be change in HOMA-IR; our primary independent variable will be average number of hours/night of PAP usage. Adjustment variables will be change in BMI %ile, pubertal stage (Tanner stage 1-2 vs.

3-5), and change in HAES. Similar analyses will be performed for our secondary outcomes.

Importance: Treatment of obesity-related OSA in adults has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. Our study is uniquely poised and timely, as it will be the first to examine the impact of PAP therapy in children on measures of insulin resistance and other obesity-related conditions. It will raise awareness of co-morbidities of obesity and OSA in childhood and support early intervention, before irreversible end-organ damage has occurred.","['Obesity', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The study was conducted as an integrated trial with two separate arms: one to facilitate weight reduction and the other to increase diabetes testing.

There were two hypotheses:

1. Women in the testing intervention will be more likely to have received a diabetes test within the 6 months post-intervention than women in the control group.
2. Women in the weight reduction intervention will have lost more weight at the 6-month and 9-month follow-up than women in the control group.

Efficacy of treatment will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires at baseline, week 8, week 16, and at a 6-month follow-up. Using fMRI at baseline and post-treatment, brain activation levels will be assessed at resting state, and while exposed to anxiety-inducing images (i.e., dirty dishes if cleanliness is an obsession). The effects of treatment on brain activation levels and the correlation between symptom changes and activation levels will be analyzed.","Study Design:

A non-randomized pilot study design will be employed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be conducted at baseline and post-treatment to evaluate activation level changes in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex. Clinically validated symptomology questionnaires will be used to evaluate treatment efficacy. Additionally, qualitative interviews will be conducted to gather personal demographic information as well as information regarding participant experience while using the online psychotherapy clinic. This study has been registered on the ClinicalTrials.Gov Protocol Registration and Results System (NCT04630197). Additionally, ethics approval has been obtained from the Queen's University Health Sciences and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board (HSREB).

Participants:

Participants (n = 10) will be recruited from family medicine and psychiatric clinics at Queen's University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre sites (Hotel Dieu Hospital and Kingston General Hospital) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Additionally, local and social media advertisements will be utilized. Participants will be enrolled in the study based on referrals from outpatient clinics, family doctors, as well as self-referrals. Those invited and interested in participating will have the study protocol explained along with an evaluation by a psychiatrist on the research team through a secured video appointment. Participants will be evaluated for a diagnosis of OCD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) \[48\]. Once a diagnosis of OCD is confirmed and the participant is given written and verbal instructions on how to participate in the online therapy, informed consent will be obtained. Inclusion criteria include the following: between the ages of 18 and 65 years at the start of the study, a diagnosis of OCD according to DSM-5, competence to consent to participate, ability to speak and read English, and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria include having any metal implants or additional factors deemed not safe to undergo an MRI scan, active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and/or active suicidal or homicidal ideation. Additionally, if a participant is receiving another form of psychotherapy, they will be excluded from the study.

e-CBT Protocol: Weekly sessions of e-CBT will be conducted through the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT), a secure, online, cloud-based mental health care delivery platform. These online sessions will consist of approximately 30 slides and interactive therapist videos, with 16 modules in total (1 module per week). The content and format of these online sessions will mirror in-person CBT for OCD. The connection between thoughts, behaviours, emotions, physical reactions, and the environment will be a focus. Moreover, mindfulness, body scanning, self-care, goal setting, thinking errors, the 5-part model, and thought records will be employed as techniques for participants. ERP will be incorporated into the e-CBT program as this is the first-line route of treatment. Slides will highlight different topics each week and include general information, an overview of skills, and homework on that topic. The homework included in each session will be submitted through OPTT and reviewed by therapists with personalized feedback provided within 3 days of submission. Weekly homework submission for feedback will be mandatory before being eligible for the next session. After each completion of the e-CBT program, participants will be interviewed to investigate their experience using OPTT and their perception of how the treatment went. Participants can access their therapy sessions from any device with internet access (desktop computer, laptop, cellphone, tablet) and can be run on a variety of internet browsers.

fMRI Protocol: All imaging procedures will occur at the Queen's University MRI Facility in Kingston, Ontario, Canada using a Siemens 3.0 Tesla whole-body MRI scanner with a standard coil. Scans will occur at baseline (pre-treatment), after week 16 (post-treatment, and at a 6-month follow-up. During scanning, participants will lay on the scanning table on their back, with their head resting on a foam pad to reduce movement. Appointments will be 1 hour.

Anatomical reference images will be captured initially. Following this, fMRI scans will occur while participants are shown neutral images and anxiety-inducing images (i.e., dirty dishes if cleanliness is an anxiety-inducing concept for a specific participant). The frontal cortex and basal ganglia will be the focuses of the imaging procedures as we are interested in the activation level changes during neural anxiety processing. These images will be standardized pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) that will be selected specifically for each patient by members of our research team.

Participants will be shown a total of 40 images (20 neutral, 20 anxiety-inducing; R = 0.5) during the fMRI scans. There will be 4 fMRI runs that occur in the following sequence:

* 5 neutral images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break, 5 anxiety-inducing images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break.
* 5 new anxiety-inducing images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break, 5 new neutral images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break.
* 5 new anxiety-inducing images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break, 5 new neutral images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break.
* 5 neutral images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break, 5 anxiety-inducing images (30s per image, 5s break between).

The images will be shown in sets (groups of 5) as opposed to intermingled as we hope this will produce a more sustained emotional state and allow for more distinct readings. The reasoning of the sets being repeated in the middle (back-to-back of the anxiety-inducing images in the example above) is for participants to not become as accustomed to the ordering. Moreover, we will change this ordering for every participant (i.e, The next participant would receive back-to-back sets of the neutral imaging in runs 2 and 3). This is done to counterbalance the imaging sets. Participants will be prompted to imagine themselves in the situations described in the images. The images will appear on a screen and then be reflected into the scanner for participants to view. 0.5% blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal difference between conditions (p \< 10-6) will be considered a detectable change (eff = 0.005).

Anatomical reference images will be captured with the phase encoding direction collected sagitaly from anterior to posterior. These images will be captured with T1-weighted high-resolution magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) images with 1 x 1 x 1 mm3 isotropic voxels. For the stimuli-exposed image acquisitions, T2\*-weighted gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) with 1.5 x 1.5 x 2 mm3 voxels will be used. A flip angle of 90 degrees and a bandwidth of 1500 Hz will be used. The field of view will be 192 x 192 mm with a 64 x 64 mm matrix resolution. With this phase encoding, the spatial resolution will be 3 mm, with an echo time (TE) of 25 ms, a repetition time (TR) of 2.5 s, and a multi-slice imaging factor of 2 being employed. With these parameters, 170 volumes will be captured. To un-distort images, the GE-EPI fMRI data will be mapped to a non-distorted set of GE images from the same participant. Next, the non-distorted GE images will be mapped to the T1-weighted MPRAGE image. Finally, the T1-weighted MPRAGE will be mapped to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) standardized brain template.

177618,NCT05561075,2022-11-17,ACTUAL,"Oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can seriously affect cells, tissues and organs. The human body is capable of counteracting ROS production by stimulating antioxidant defense systems and consequently adapting to the oxidative challenge.

Several transcription factors are involved in the induction of antioxidant genes. Activators of nuclear factor derived from erythroid 2 (NRF2), a protein that controls the expression of certain genes, are considered agents capable of inducing antioxidant capacity and to alleviate ROS. There are some food bioactive compounds, including polyphenols, capable of activating NRF2.

Pterostilbene (PT) is a stilbenoid found in many natural sources, and is emerging as an antioxidant due to its potential preventive and therapeutic properties in a long list of diseases. Despite its apparent properties, the water solubility and bioavailability of PT are low.

The co-crystallization of nutraceuticals is a recent strategy based on crystal engineering to overcome their low solubility and, therefore, their low oral bioavailability. It has been identified and characterized a cocrystal of pterostilbene that can increase oral bioavailability in animals by up to 10 times compared to the commercial free base PT.

The main objective of the study is to evaluate the oral bioavailability of the crystallized form of pterostilbene (ccPT) compared to its commercial free base form (pterostilbene (PT).

351995,NCT06523582,2037-03-01,ESTIMATED,"Neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) are a heterogeneous group of lesions derived from cells with the ability to produce hormones that may arise from multiple different organs. Their clinical behavior is quite variable, encompassing both benign lesions and aggressive tumors that invade surrounding and/or distant structures. NENs may also cause serious morbidity due to hormone oversecretion. NENs are among the most frequently inherited human tumors, presenting either isolated or as part of syndromes in which a single patient or family develops multiple tumors. There are also non-inherited changes in the genetic information of the tumor cells that are potential targets for treatment. Both inherited and non-inherited DNA defects can be identified using modern routine genetic tests which, unfortunately, are not widely available in Mexico.

This project seeks to uncover the genetic defects causing NENs in a large cohort of Mexican patients, using three different methods for genetic testing. Adult individuals with various types of NENs from two reference hospitals in Mexico City will be invited to participate. After completing informed consent, blood and, if possible, tissue samples will be obtained from all participants. Clinical details, laboratory results, imaging studies, and histopathological data at disease presentation will be retrieved.

An initial screening will be performed by analyzing changes in the sequence of multiple genes that have been associated with the occurrence of NENs. In cases with negative screening, a specific method to assess changes in the number of copies of the same genes will also be employed. Finally, sequences of all DNA regions encoding information required to make proteins will be obtained in selected cases. Analyses will be carried out in blood and, if available, also in tumor tissue samples from study participants. Screening of additional family members will be offered.

This project will accurately describe the repertoire of specific defects causing NENs in the study population, and will likely uncover and characterize novel genetic associations. The results will contribute for a better understanding of the alterations within and outside known driver genes that shape syndromic presentations, tumor behaviors, and inheritance patterns in individuals with NENs. These data will contribute to improve the information on the molecular bases of NENs, including alterations that can be used as therapeutic targets.","Introduction.

NENs are a heterogeneous group of human neoplasms with a variable clinical behavior, spanning from indolence to frank aggressiveness and malignancy. They arise from various tissues with common embryological origins that share the capacity for producing hormones. Their growth might compromise surrounding structures and they often cause significant morbidity due to their associated syndromes of hormone oversecretion. Although traditionally considered rare, the frequency of NENs has greatly increased in the last decades, due to improved clinical awareness and diagnostic strategies. This group includes lesions such as bronchopulmonary, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, and thymic NENs, medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), paragangliomas and pheochromocytomas (PPGLs), parathyroid adenomas and carcinomas, and pituitary neuroendocrine tumors (PitNETs), among others.

Interestingly, NENs are among the human neoplasms with a strongest heritable component. Some NENs are part of autosomal dominant syndromes of multiple endocrine neoplasia, where they present in combination with other characteristic endocrine and non-endocrine tumors in the same individual and/or family. Clinical descriptions of such entities exist in the literature since the mid-twentieth Century, although their genetic causes were not determined until three or four decades ago. In other instances, a single type of tumor, such as MTC, PitNETs, or PPGLs, arises in multiple members of the same family, without other associated features. Occasionally, individuals with apparently sporadic presentation are indeed simplex cases of familial conditions. It is currently known that around 50% of cases of MTC, 40% of PPGLs, 20% of gastrointestinal, pancreatic, bronchopulmonary, and thymic NENs, 15% of parathyroid NENs, and 5-10% of PitNETs are due to germline defects. Aside from heritable genetic defects, alterations at the somatic level determine specific clinical courses in both sporadic and familial NENs.

In the last decade, the widespread use of powerful tools for genetic analyses has resulted in a dramatic increase in the known genetic causes of NENs. These approaches have also yielded previously unsuspected genotype-phenotype associations and have uncovered a great overlap in the clinical presentation of different syndromes of multiple endocrine neoplasia. Genetic tests are key for early diagnosis, tailored clinical management, and genetic counseling. Moreover, genetic analyses on the tumors have uncovered potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Yet, platforms for genetic diagnosis are not widely available and data on genetic disease drivers do not accurately represent all human populations. Genetic tests are not widely available in Mexico and are almost non-existent in its public hospitals, which serve the majority of the country's ∼128 million population. Interestingly, Mestizos, which account for most of the Mexican population, are one of the most genetically diverse human groups. Precision medicine strategies require population-specific information, yet, Mexican Mestizos are poorly represented in international genetic databases.

Aims.

Using a precise, robust, and affordable testing platform, this project will describe the repertoire and frequency of germline and somatic genetic causes of NENs in a large prospective cohort of Mexican Mestizos. It will also define the phenotypes and clinical outcomes associated with specific genetic defects and explore the functional consequences of new defects in genes previously associated with these neoplasms. Finally, it will uncover and thoroughly characterize novel genetic associations, including potential druggable targets.

Methods.

Approval for the study has been obtained from the Institutional Review Boards of two reference hospitals: Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán (INCMNSZ, project 4090), and Hospital de Especialidades de Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI, Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (IMSS, project R-2022-785-011). Under informed consent, DNA samples from blood and fresh or formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tumors will be obtained. All experimental methods, except exome sequencing, will be carried out at the Research Support Network of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México and INCMNSZ. The study started in August 2022 and is designed as a 15-year prospective cohort with an estimated total of 750 participants. Adult individuals (age ≥18 years at recruitment) with new or previous diagnosis of any type of NEN will be invited to participate, including sporadic, familial, isolated, and syndromic presentations. All participants will be offered the opportunity to obtain the results of their genetic studies. A unique deidentified code will be used to label all samples and data collected for each participant, to protect their personal information.

Details on family history, clinical presentation, biochemical, imaging, histopathological, and previous genetic studies for each participant will be entered into a deidentified electronic clinical database. Data on clinical outcomes will be collected prospectively for a maximum of 15 years. For all cases, a 5 ml peripheral blood sample will be collected in a tube with EDTA at recruitment and stored at 4°C until processing. DNA will be extracted from blood samples within 24 h after collection. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples will be obtained for patients with previous tumor resection, when available. When possible and without interfering with routine histopathological analyses, fresh frozen tissue samples will be obtained from individuals undergoing surgical tumor excision in the course of the study. Frozen tissues will be stored in liquid nitrogen until processing. DNA will be extracted from all tissue samples and RNA will be extracted from blood or tissue samples in selected cases. Sample quality and concentration will be analyzed by spectrophotometry and fluorometry. DNA will be stored at -20 °C and RNA will be stored at -80 °C for the duration of the study.

DNA samples will be analyzed using multiple techniques, consisting of a first step of targeted next generation sequencing (NGS), followed by targeted array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and exome sequencing (ES). For NGS, a customized panel including 54 genes with a known association with NENs has been designed, using the Twist Biosciences platform. Libraries from blood DNA from all participants and, when possible, fresh tumor DNA, will be prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and sequenced in an Illumina MiSeq instrument at an approximate depth of 300x. Sequences will be mapped to the GRCh38/hg38 human genome, PCR duplicates will be marked, and variant calling will be carried out for single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, and copy number variants. Variants will be selected based on their frequency (\<0.1% in both general population and Mexican population databases), previous classification (according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines) reported in ClinVar, results from multiple in silico prediction tools, and literature search for additional clinical and experimental data.

For selected cases remaining without genetic diagnosis after the NGS panel, CNV analysis of the same targeted regions will be carried out. For this purpose, a high density aCGH targeting the same regions of interest than the NGS panel has been designed, using the Agilent SureDesign platform. Samples will be processed in a 16 x 25 K array format and the results will be analyzed with the Agilent Genomic Workbench software. Variant filtering and classification will be done in a similar manner as described for SNVs and indels.

All relevant variants classified as pathogenic and likely pathogenic will be subjected to orthogonal validation (Sanger sequencing for SNVs and indels and droplet digital polymerase chain reaction for CNVs). All participants choosing to know their results will receive detailed reports including all relevant variants of uncertain significance (VUS), as well as likely pathogenic, and pathogenic variants with an interpretation of their clinical significance. When clinically indicated, participants will be offered cascade targeted screening of additional family members. Selected VUS, including variants not previously reported, will be subjected to additional evaluations, including search for loss of heterozygosity in tumor tissues, expression assays, coding DNA sequencing and/or breakpoint analyses in blood and/or tumor tissues, or experimental functional validation.

The genetic results will be correlated with the clinical data to determine the frequency and type of genetic defects associated to each phenotype in the study population. Conversely, thorough clinical descriptions of the repertoire of phenotypes associated with each specific genetic defect will be obtained. The influence of particular genotype-phenotype associations on the clinical presentation and clinical outcomes will also be explored. Cases with no genetic diagnosis after targeted NGS and aCGH will be subjected to exome sequencing. Groups of patients with similar phenotypes will be analyzed together to identify disease-specific defects in genes not previously associated with NENs. Novel candidate associations will be thoroughly characterized using custom-designed combinations of experimental approaches plus additional screening in affected families.

Expected results.

Incorporating multiple phenotypes of NENs in the proposed novel platform for general genotyping will significantly improve the probability of variant detection, compared with the currently available genetic tests. In addition to generating a large amount of genetic and clinical data for previously unexplored phenotypes in the study population, this project will very likely also identify novel disease modifiers and founder variants. These data will contribute to the development of population- and genotype-specific strategies for genetic counseling, early diagnosis, clinical follow up, and treatment, thereby improving the future outcomes of individuals with NENs. This strategy will uncover the landscape of germline and somatic NEN-associated defects in an extremely genetically diverse population that is poorly represented in international studies. The results will be compared with data from other populations to better understand the alterations within and outside known driver genes that shape syndromic presentations, tumor behaviors, and inheritance patterns in NENs.","['Neuroendocrine Neoplasm', 'Neuroendocrine Neoplasm of Gastrointestinal Tract', 'Neuroendocrine Neoplasm of Lung', 'Thymic Neuroendocrine Neoplasm', 'Neuroendocrine Tumor of Pancreas', 'Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors', 'Medullary Thyroid Cancer', 'Paraganglioma', 'Pheochromocytoma', 'Primary Hyperparathyroidism', 'Pituitary Tumor', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 1', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2', 'Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 4', 'Carney Complex', 'Carney Stratakis Dyad', 'Carney Triad', 'Cowden Syndrome', 'DICER1 Syndrome', 'Li-Fraumeni Syndrome', 'Lynch Syndrome', 'Von Hippel-Lindau Disease', 'Familial Isolated Pituitary Adenoma', 'X-Linked Acrogigantism', 'Neurofibromatosis 1', 'Tuberous Sclerosis']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

287228,NCT05302414,2022-12,ESTIMATED,"It is challenging for healthcare team to manage emergency patient effectively. Most of these critical patients have medical conditions and need complex medical managements. Research findings have shown that poor healthcare teamwork would result in poor communication, missing information, and insufficient situation monitoring and thus compromise patient safety. Simulation has been proved as an effective method to develop teamwork competency. However, comparing to traditional training model, simulation requires more resources such as funding, spaces, time, administration staffs, schedule, facilitators, and equipment. It would not be easy to delivery in various professional departments. Game-based learning was a known effective and learner-centered learning model which required less resources. Researchers have shown that game-based learning has higher acceptance for the learners and can improve learners' knowledge, attitude, motivation, and performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the learning effectiveness of resuscitation teamwork training of board game-based learning, simulation-based learning and lecture-based learning in PGY doctors and nurses.","This will be a prospective, longitudinal, and randomized controlled trial design. A total number of 180 PGY doctors and nurses will be enrolled from a teaching hospital in northern Taipei City.

Three groups will receive ""Emergency Medical Response Teamwork"" training and all of these contents were developed according to America Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and ECC and TeamSTEPPS curriculum from Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. We will collect the professional demography, the professional medical knowledge for medical management, the concept of knowledge for teamwork, team performance, team attitude, medical management, course survey, and cognitive load scales. We will compare the learning effectiveness between three groups in pre test, post-test, and three month later after post-test.

Study hypothesis: In individuals with transtibial amputation, telerehabilitation-based structured exercise has an effect on muscle strength, balance, performance, body image, prosthesis adaptation, activity limitation, prosthesis use satisfaction, and quality of life. Forty individuals with a unilateral transtibial amputation will be included in the study. Participants will be divided into two groups as telerehabilitation and control groups with equal sample sizes by the randomization method. All participants will undergo a 6-week exercise program. A structured exercise program supported by telerehabilitation will be applied to the telerehabilitation group 3 days a week, and a home exercise program will be applied on the remaining days of the week. An only a home exercise program will be applied to the control group. Participants will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the study.","Amputation is a major trauma that significantly disrupts the biomechanics of the musculoskeletal system, results in serious physical and psychological loss, and completely affects the quality of life, social and professional life of the individual. Due to the increase in the elderly population and the incidence of diabetes and vascular diseases in the world, the number of individuals with amputation is increasing day by day. Approximately 150,000 lower extremity amputations are performed each year in the United States alone. The number of amputated individuals worldwide is expected to double by 2050. The most common amputation level in the world and in our country is transtibial amputations and approximately 39% of all amputations are performed at this level. In addition, the most common prosthesis use among individuals with lower extremity amputations is seen in those with the transtibial amputation level. Individuals who have undergone transtibial amputation have lost the foot-ankle complex and all related muscular functions. After transtibial amputation surgery, loss of proprioceptive information occurs in ankle control and in foot-ankle and all lower extremity muscles due to loss of exteroceptors around the foot. This leads to loss of balance during standing, stepping, and walking.

Physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices are needed in order for individuals with amputations to use their prostheses effectively and have a successful prosthesis adaptation. After the transtibial amputation, early period physiotherapy applications are followed by the use of prosthesis, and prosthetic period rehabilitation applications are continued. Prosthetic rehabilitation in individuals with transtibial amputation; aims to provide balance by taking into account the losses after amputation, to gain close to normal walking with minimum energy consumption, to ensure maximum independence in a safe manner by taking into account the pre-amputation lifestyles, expectations, and medical limitations of individuals. Physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices in individuals with transtibial amputation consist of a long-term process that starts before amputation and includes the early period after amputation, the prosthetic period, and returns to social life. Factors such as the long-term physiotherapy needs of individuals with transtibial amputation, the presence of gait and balance problems, geographical conditions, financial inadequacies, and epidemic diseases may cause problems for these individuals to reach the physiotherapy and rehabilitation applications offered in health institutions. In order to facilitate participation in physiotherapy and rehabilitation practices and to reduce resource use, telerehabilitation practices are recommended for individuals with amputation, as with other diseases that require rehabilitation. It is thought that telerehabilitation can be a useful and practical method for individuals with transtibial amputation where it is difficult and tiring to go to the clinic.

In the literature, it has been observed that there are very few studies examining the effects of physiotherapy and rehabilitation on parameters such as muscle strength, balance, gait, performance, body image, prosthesis fit, prosthesis use satisfaction, and quality of life in the rehabilitation of individuals with transtibial amputation. In addition, there are very few studies in the literature that include telerehabilitation applications related to transtibial amputations, and there is no study that questions the effects of structured exercise programs. This study was planned in order to determine the effects of telerehabilitation applications on muscle strength, kinesiophobia, balance, activity limitation, body image, prosthesis compliance and satisfaction with use, and quality of life in individuals with transtibial amputation. It is aimed to guide physiotherapists whether they prefer telerehabilitation applications as an evidence-based practice among rehabilitation methods in this field.

It is aimed to investigate the effects of telerehabilitation-based structured exercise on muscle strength, balance, performance, body image, prosthesis adaptation, activity limitation, prosthesis use satisfaction, and quality of life in individuals with unilateral transtibial amputation.

In order to determine the number of samples in the study; the alpha significance level of the hypothesis was 0.05; the effect size was determined as 0.5 and power as 0.85. As a result of the analysis; The research will be carried out with a total of 40 people, 20 people in each group.

Forty individuals with a unilateral transtibial amputation will be included in the study. Participants will be divided into two groups as telerehabilitation and control groups with equal sample sizes by the randomization method. All participants will undergo a 6-week exercise program. A structured exercise program supported by telerehabilitation will be applied to the telerehabilitation group 3 days a week, and a home exercise program will be applied on the remaining days of the week. An only a home exercise program will be applied to the control group. Participants will be evaluated at the beginning and end of the study.

Method of the Study:

* A mobile telecommunication group will be formed, including the participants and the physiotherapist. Communication with the participants will be provided here. In addition, one-on-one or collective teleconferences will be held with the participants when necessary.
* Before each session, the telerehabilitation group will be shown how to do the exercises online by the researcher, and it will be ensured that the patients do the exercises correctly and are followed up. In addition, at the beginning of each week, videos with the exercise content of that week will also be sent.
* The control group will be given exercise cards showing the home exercise program at the beginning of the treatment.
* Tracking of the exercises will be done with the exercise diary Statistical analysis: In the analysis of the data, statistical analysis including a descriptive, comparator, and correlation will be made. Mean, standard deviation and percentage distributions will be calculated for descriptive data. In the analysis of the repeated measurement results of the scales, ANOVA will be applied for the data conforming to the normal distribution. The student's t-test will be used for parametric data and Mann Whitney-U test for non-parametric data.","['Amputation', 'Telerehabilitation', 'Exercise', 'Prosthesis User']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Donors will be specifically screened for Fusobacterium and Sutterella species as well as for global diversity. It is unknown if treatment with antibiotics before FMT improves the engraftment and/or efficacy of FMT in UC, therefore the researchers plan to randomize subjects to receive pre-treatment with antibiotics or not before FMT therapy. The research team enroll patients from The Susan and Leonard Feinstein IBD Center and our established early diagnosis clinic at Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH).","This is an open-label two arm pilot study to measure the safety, microbiological and clinical impacts of FMT in patients with ulcerative colitis. The researchers will prospectively enroll 16 UC patients (up to 20 subjects accounting for subjects dropping out) with moderate-severe disease from one tertiary care referral center. The overall objective of the study is to collect robust clinical data and create a tissue repository including blood, stool and biopsies to understand the safety, efficacy and microbial changes FMT has on UC patients. The central hypothesis is that pre-defined oral capsule administered FMT is safe and effective for the treatment of UC.

Objectives: To determine the tolerability, feasibility, and safety of using fecal microbiota transplantation orally as an induction agent for patients with ulcerative colitis. To determine whether fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) delivered via oral capsules can induce clinical remission in patients with mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Assess whether pretreatment with antibiotics improves engraftment and efficacy of FMT in UC. To characterize the impact of orally administered FMT on the microbiota of patients with ulcerative colitis, particularly those changes associated with response or lack of response.

23429,NCT00513708,2008-08,ACTUAL,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether peer visits (known as ""12th Step Calls"") and professional counselors (using ""Motivational Enhancement Therapy"") are effective helping alcoholics link to substance abuse treatment programs after being in the hospital for detox.","For those with an alcohol use disorder, the decision to seek detoxification treatment often represents a desire or willingness to change drinking behavior. This gives clinicians with the opportunity to intervene and improve the lives of these individuals. Even patients admitted involuntarily or who have been coerced may be amenable to change. Therefore, inpatient alcohol detoxification treatment offers an opportunity to prepare these patients for and link them with aftercare treatment.

Unfortunately, clinicians have little to guide them on how the current standard of care for alcohol detoxification might be improved. Improvement in clinical practice is ideally driven by clinical research, but there is little recent published information to guide the development of evidence-based pharmacological or psychological practices or interventions in detoxification settings. As a result, alcohol detoxification treatment has changed little over the past 25 years.

Taken as a whole, the literature suggests that the outcomes of inpatient detoxification are less than optimal. A limited number of published studies suggest that a majority of these patients are not linked to any aftercare following inpatient detoxification treatment and return to drinking within a few weeks of hospital discharge. However, there is some evidence to suggest that interventions, performed while the patient is hospitalized, could encourage patients to initiate involvement in aftercare (i.e., professional treatment and/or mutual self-help following hospitalization) and to decrease drinking or initiate abstinence. Motivational Enhancement Therapy and Twelve-Step Facilitation are two interventions that show promise.

The study proposed in this study addresses this issue by testing two brief interventions, Motivation Enhancement Therapy (MET) and Peer-Twelve Step Facilitation (P-TSF, also known as ""12th Step Calls""), which have shown potential to enhance initiation of a period of abstinence and engagement in treatment and/or self-help programs among alcohol detoxification patients.","['Alcohol Abuse', 'Alcohol Dependence']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

It is also reasonable to expect that this process may be further attenuated by the addition of an anti-thrombin agent (such as warfarin) in combination with antiplatelet agents.

WAVE is a large, international, multicentre, randomized clinical trial in high-risk PVD patients to evaluate the additional benefit of moderate intensity warfarin (target INR of 2.4-3.0) to antiplatelet therapy compared to antiplatelet therapy alone in reducing serious cardiovascular events.

There are currently 80 active centres following participants in Canada, Poland, Australia, Hungary, China, Ukraine, and the Netherlands. Following randomization to one of the two treatment groups, participants will require clinic or phone follow-up visits every 3 months for 2.5 or 3.5 years. For participants on warfarin, INRs will be measured monthly or more frequently if required. For participants who stop warfarin therapy prematurely, every attempt will be made to have them restart it","['Peripheral Vascular Diseases', 'Cardiovascular Diseases']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The study design is multicentre, open, randomised, 4 x 2 stratified. The study duration is 24 months (individual period of investigation), 1. study phase: 12 moths (protocol part B) and 2. study phase: 12 moths (part C).

Part B - Study phase 1 B1.1 Clinical hypothesis Compared to maintenance with oral methadone, heroin treatment leads to

* significant improvement of the physical and/or mental state of health,
* greater reduction of illicit drug use and therefore greater detachment from the drug scene,
* significant improvement of the social situation,
* higher retention rate or attachment to treatment, in the case of those heroin dependent persons who could not be effectively reached or could not sufficiently profit from methadone maintenance programmes.

B1.2 Primary outcome criteria

* Improvement of the physical and mental state of health (A) AND
* Reduction of illicit heroin use and non-increase of cocaine use (B). B1.3 Secondary outcome criteria
* Retention rate
* Reduction of benzodiazepine, amphetamine, alcohol and other drug use
* Reduction of scene contacts / of contacts to other drug consumers
* Decrease of delinquent behaviour
* Stabilisation of housing situation
* Establishment of new social contacts
* Improvement of quality of life
* Mortality rate. B2. STUDY DESIGN Phase 1 of the clinical trial consists in a 4 x 2-branched randomised multicentre study. The sample is stratified and consists on the one hand of heroin dependent persons in methadone maintenance treatment that do not sufficiently profit from treatment (MS), and on the other hand of heroin dependent persons who are currently not being treated for their addiction (NE). Patients of both target groups who meet the admission criteria will be randomised to four arms: experimental groups (MS-E-C) and (NE-E-C): heroin treatment with concurrent case management, experimental groups (MS-E-P) and (NE-E-P): heroin treatment with concurrent psychoeducation/drug counseling and control groups (MS-K-C) and (NE-K-C): methadone treatment with concurrent case management, control groups (MS-K-P) and (NE-K-P): methadone treatment with concurrent psychoeducation/drug counseling.

B2.2 Recruitment of patients The period of registration is not part of the individual study period. A screening is carried out at registration concerning certain inclusion criteria. The patients are given the opportunity of a thorough information concerning the conditions and course of the study.

First of all, patients are asked to sign their consent to participate in the study. This is followed by the indication assessment (T-1) by the study physician and the external interview (EuropASI). Certain (particularly medical) characteristics are again examined at the beginning of treatment (T0).

The regionally responsible study physician will decide on the inclusion in the study. His decision needs the confirmation of a regional committee of experts.

B2.3 Randomisation The allocation to treatment places of the experimental or control group is carried out according to a randomisation code. Randomisation is done separately for both groups (MS and NE) based on permuted blocks of fixed size.

After the evaluation of the indication assessment and the first interview (at T-1), patients who have been recruited and who fulfil the inclusion criteria are then asked to give a second consent of participation in the study, and the results of randomisation will be communicated to them.

B2.4 Course of the study, examinations and times of the investigations The first phase of the clinical trial covers a period of 12 months. All questioning is done in a personal interview (""face to face"") with the assurance that all information will be confidential.

All patients who take part in the interviews receive an expense allowance of Euro 15.- for each survey.

A hair sample is already taken at the indication examination (T-1). This allows taking a hair sample fit for analysis at the beginning of treatment (T0) from those patients whose hair was too short at T-1. The CIDI will be carried out after one month of treatment in order to minimise initial influences requiring treatment.

In order to determine the use of illicit heroin, which is a main target criterion, five urine controls will be thoroughly examined by GC/MS both in the 6th and the 12th month of treatment.

B3. PATIENTS The adequate treatment of the questions posed by this study requires a number of at least 140 patients in each test group (4 experimental and 4 control groups). Therefore, the sample size for the entire study will be N=1,120.

* Patients who are currently participating in another clinical study concerned with the evaluation of an addiction treatment programme.

B3.3 Dropping out of treatment

Participation in the study is voluntary i.e. the patient can withdraw his consent to be treated (and to further participation in the study) at any time. Patients having at least one of the following characteristics are removed from treatment:

* Patients suffering from serious somatic complications in connection with heroin or methadone treatment for whom a continuation of treatment would be irresponsible in the opinion of the test study physician and the safety board
* Patients with abnormally changed laboratory values for whom a continuation of treatment would incur great health risks according to the safety board's decision
* Patients who have not turned up at the treatment centre or who have discontinued the study medication for a period of 14 days (or longer) for self-provoked reasons or without giving reasons
* Patients who are taken into custody for one month or longer
* Heroin patients whose treatment must be discontinued for more than 3 months due to hospitalisation or other special treatments
* Patients who, in the opinion of the study physician, cannot or do not want to comply with the conditions of the model project any longer, i.e. participation in the therapeutic and scientific programme
* In case of violence, threat of violence against persons involved in the project or other patients
* In case of drug trafficking on the premises of the model project
* In case of theft, passing on or sale of prescribed substances. B4. TREATMENT B4.1 Treatment setting Patients will be treated in an outpatient clinic. The setting is based on at least weekly contacts to the treating physician. Detailed physical examinations and blood counts (10 ml for each withdrawal) take place at the start of treatment and after 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. There will be weekly urine analyses (qualitative proofs). In addition, a hair sample will be taken from an inconspicuous place at the back of the head at the beginning of treatment (at admission), after 6 months and at the examination after 12 months. Patients under the influence of alcohol, barbiturates or benzodiazepines can be refused their heroin or methadone dose. If excessive alcohol consumption is suspected (smell of alcohol) a breath test is undertaken. If the breath test is above 0.1, heroin or methadone will be refused.

B4.3 Dose regimen Heroin (in combination with methadone) An additional medication of d-1 methadone at night will be offered from the start, i.e. on the second day of treatment at the earliest. The administration of heroin will occur up to 3 times a day during the opening hours of the setting, in the morning, at noon and in the evening. In accordance with the Swiss and Dutch studies, the maximum daily dose of i.v. heroin will be 1,000 mg, the single dose 400 mg. If methadone is claimed at night, it can be taken on the premises during the evening opening hours or taken out as a drinkable, not injectable single dose. The daily maximum dose of additionally prescribed d,l methadone should not exceed 60 mg. Methadone consumption will be controlled by regular urine analyses.

Heroin will be handed out as injectable single doses (in filled syringes) and administered by the patient himself under observation. Patients should stay in the centre for at least 30 minutes after the injection, in order to control for possible unwanted effects.

The different dose regimens (dose regulation at the beginning of treatment or after interruptions starting from different points, fading out in case of (un-)planned treatment conclusions) are based on methadone daily equivalence doses (MTQ). According to the basic rule of the different dose regimens, an individual dose of i.v. heroin for one day, alone or in combination with oral methadone, must not exceed the MTQ of the previous day by more than 50%.

Methadone Oral methadone will be administered once a day. It is taken on the premises under observation as drinkable, not injectable single dose. There is no fixed maximum daily dose; according to experience, dosages between 40 and 160 mg/d of methadone (in individual cases up to 250 mg/d) must be expected. A 1% methadone HCL solution is recommended.

Dose regimen at the conclusion of treatment The conclusion of treatment is done by a step-by-step discontinuation of i.v. heroin or change to oral methadone. The discontinuation of medication (i.v. heroin alone or in combination with methadone) will be done slowly. Preferably, the reduction should not be more than 10%-20% of the MTQ of the previous day. In most cases discontinuation can be completed within 2 weeks. Possible withdrawal symptoms can be treated by concomitant medication.

B5. VARIABLES B5.1 General patient characteristics General and specific sample characteristics such as gender, age, length of opiate dependency, number of previous treatments, current social situation are documented.

B5.2 Medical examination and prescription data, laboratory parameters The daily amounts of heroin or methadone handed out are registered and all further prescriptions are documented. Medical examinations are documented in the CRF.

B5.3 Pharmacokinetics Since pharmacokinetics, the analgetic effects, the tolerance effects and the addiction potential of heroin are well known and new findings are not to be expected within the framework of this study, the study focuses mainly on questions concerning the effects and safety of medication.

B5.4 Efficacy Primary outcome variables Efficacy is investigated with regard to two primary outcome measures - improvement of the state of health (A) and reduction of illicit drug consumption (B). These criteria will be evaluated independently by the statistical comparative analysis; the success of one treatment in comparison to the other treatment is only proven, if both analyses have significant results pointing in the same direction.

State of health (A)

A1. Physical state of health:

Number of symptoms according to the health scale of the Opiate Treatment Index OTI at T 1 and T12.

VA1n = OTI-Health Scale (0 ≤ VA1n ≤ 50).

A2. Mental state of health:

Global Severity Index GSI of the SCL-90-R at T 1 and T12. VA2n = GSI value (0 ≤ VA2n ≤ 4).

The treatment response concerning the improvement of the state of health is given, if one of the two criteria (VA1 or VA2) shows an improvement and the other criteria shows no aggravation. Improvement and aggravation are defined as follows:

* For the physical state of health (VA1): An improvement is indicated by a decrease on the OTI health scale by at least 20% and at least 4 points if T12 is compared with T-1, an aggravation is an increase of at least 20%.
* For the mental state of health (VA2): An improvement is indicated by a decrease of the GSI value by at least 20% if T12 is compared with T-1, an aggravation is an increase of at least 20%.

Illicit drug consumption (B)

B1. Use of illicit heroin:

Number of illicit heroin-positive urine analyses during the 12 months of treatment, i.e. among the last 5 urine samples before T12.

VB1n = number of positive urine samples (0 ≤ VB1 ≤ 5). If the patient has dropped out of treatment, and results at T12 are missing and the LOCF procedure is not possible because of missing urine samples in the 6th month of treatment, but if at least one follow-up has occurred within the ITT method, the patient's self-reported data on use of illicit heroin (physician-CRF) will be used. If these are also missing, self-reported data from the external interview can be used. This will be based on the number of days with illicit heroin consumption during the last 30 days (VB1') before the corresponding time of investigation.

VB1'n = number of illicit heroin consumption days (0 ≤ VB1' ≤ 30).

B2. Cocaine use:

Cocaine concentration of hair based on hair analyses (HAs) at T-1 and T12 within following proof limits:

VB2 n = cocaine concentration (VB2 n ≥ 1 μg/g). If the patient has dropped out of treatment, if results at T12 are missing and the LOCF procedure is not possible because of missing HA at T6, but if at least one follow-up has occurred within the ITT method, the patient's self-reported data on cocaine consumption (physician-CRF) will be used. If these are also missing, self-reported data from the external interview can be used. This will be based on the number of days with cocaine use during the last 30 days (VB2') before the corresponding time of investigation.

VB2'n = number of cocaine consumption days (0 ≤ VB2' ≤ 30). HA does not represent the frequency but the integral intensity within the (past) period of observation assuming an average hair growth of 10 mm per month. The lower limit of proof is assumed to be 1μg/g. An increase of cocaine consumption can be accurately proven, if the value at T12 has increased by 30% in comparison to T-1. (If the hair is too short - less than 1.5 cm - to take a sample at T-1, it will be done at T0.)

Decrease and non-increase of consumption are defined as follows:

* A decrease of illicit heroin use is assumed to be proven, if not more than 2 of the 5 urine samples tested by GC/MS by the 12th month of treatment are positive. If only 4 urine samples are available by the 12th month of treatment, only one urine sample may be positive to illicit heroin. If only 3 urine samples are available, none may be positive to illicit heroin in order to be rated as response. If fewer urine samples are available by the 12th month of treatment, the analyses at the 6th month will be used (LOCF), proceeding according to the same evaluation pattern. Only if no usable urine analyses of the 6th month of treatment exist, the patient's self-report will be used (VB1'). A reduction of illicit heroin consumption of at least 60% between T-1 and T12 in relation to the number of consumption days during the last 30 days is rated as a response.
* The non-increase of cocaine use is proven by the (provable) cocaine concentration in the hair. If a HA cannot be carried out at T12, the hair sample at T6 will be used (LOCF). Only if a usable HA is neither available at T6 (due to a premature discontinuation of treatment), the patient's self report (VB2') will be used. A decrease or no change (with a tolerance of ± 2 days) of the number of consumption days within the last 30 days between T-1 and T12 is rated as a response. I.e. an increase of the number of days with cocaine consumption during the last month of not more than 2 days compared to T-1 is still rated as a response; only an increase at T12 by more than 2 days is rated as non-response.

It has to be assumed that a certain number of patients will prematurely (before initiation of treatment or within the first 3 months) drop-out of treatment (in the case of methadone about 20% up to 40%, in the case of heroin 10%-20%), but that they can be reached again for the examinations and investigations. These patients can be summoned for examination at the fixed times, but 5 urine samples during the last month will not be available from them. These patients without valid data are rated as non-responders in the heroin group and as ""worst case"" responders in the methadone group. Thus, because a rather high percentage of dropouts in the control group have to be expected, it would be hardly possible to prove the su¬periority of the experimental treatment. In that case, the (negative) result of the study would be caused by problems attributable to the implementation and measuring circumstances of the target criteria so that the evaluation of changes cannot be carried out adequately. Under the specified evaluation strategy, the procedure of measuring the consumption primary outcome measures exclusively by objective methods cannot be maintained.

If 5 urine samples are required within a defined period and 2 at most may be positive, a deviation of this pattern (e.g. urine samples are missing or cannot be used, the patient does not turn up any more) prevents that the primary outcome measures can be reliably investigated and documented. If this happens at T12, a compensation with data at T6 is possible (LOCF). It must be assumed, however, that dropouts occur most often during the first weeks, days or even im¬mediately before the beginning of treatment so that a great number of patients never reaches point T6 for the necessary objective measuring; therefore, it is not realistic to summon dropouts for urine samples 5 times with weekly intervals during the 6th and the 12th month.

An increase of cocaine use is proven by hair analyses (HA). It must be expected also in this case that, for various reasons, a certain number of patients (though much less) will not provide a hair sample at T6 or T12.

Therefore, missing or not useable data concerning the primary outcome measures of illicit heroin use (VB1) and cocaine use (VB2) respectively will be compensated by the patient's report on his consumption during the last 30 days. This procedure is as objective as possible; results are only compensated by subjective data in exceptional cases (dropouts, incorrect or missing data).

The general treatment response is shown by an improvement of the state of health (physical or mental symptoms) and by a decrease of illicit heroin consumption as well as by the non-increase of cocaine consumption between the beginning of treatment and the conclusion of phase 1 of the study.

B5.5 Safety Serious adverse events (SUE), adverse events (UE) and side effects (UAW) must be recorded consistently throughout the study. Side effects will be investigated quantitatively. At each investigation, following effects and side effects related to intoxication will be examined routinely.

The blood controls carried out within the study will be checked for laboratory test abnormalities. Such changes will be documented in the CRF and added to the adverse events (UE) and, if applicable, to the unwanted side effects (UAW).

B6. STATISTICAL ANALYSES B6.1 Safety analysis Under inclusion of all persons who have been randomised, an analysis of emergencies, adverse events (UE) and serious adverse events (SUE) will be carried out. With regard to such events (prevalence, severity classification) potential group differences will be checked for statistical significance.

B6.2 Efficacy analysis The primary outcome analysis will be carried out according to the ""intention to treat"" principle (ITT), which includes all randomised patients, i.e. all patients who were assigned to one of the treatment groups after twice repeated written consent. With regard to the 4 x 2-branched study design, a 4-factorial logistic regression model will be used. In case of missing information, the ""last observation carried forward"" method (LOCF) will be applied.

Primary outcome analysis For the experimental and the control groups, this proof of superiority of heroin will be furnished by a 4-factorial logistic regression model; two separated analyses will be calculated for the criterion ""improvement of the state of health"" (A) and for the criterion ""reduction of illicit drug consumption"" (B).

An overall success of the study (proof of the superiority of heroin treatment compared to methadone treatment) is assumed if, both for the main target criterion (A) ""improvement of the state of health"" and the main target criterion (B) ""reduction of illicit drug consumption"", a superiority of heroin treatment in comparison to methadone treatment can be proven in the respective logistic regression model with an α-error of 5%.

Primary outcome criterion (A) - Improvement of the state of health:

H0A: OR ≤ 1 (Response rate in heroin treatment ≤ Response rate in methadone treatment), H1A: OR \> 1 (Response rate in heroin treatment \> Response rate in methadone treatment).

The hypothesis is tested one-tailed with a 2.5% alpha error level.

Primary outcome criterion (B) - reduction of illicit drug consumption:

H0B: OR ≥ 1 (Rate of illegal drug use in heroin treatment ≥ in methadone treatment), H1B: OR \< 1 (Rate of illegal drug use in heroin treatment \< in methadone treatment).

This hypothesis is also tested one-tailed with a 2.5% alpha error level.

Proof of the overall effect of heroin treatment:

The experimental treatment (controlled heroin treatment) will be rated to be successful, if the logistic regression has following results:

* a response rate for the outcome criterion ""improvement of the state of health"" (A) signifi¬cantly higher in comparison with the control treatment (methadone maintenance) AND
* a response rate for the outcome criterion ""reduction of illicit drug consumption"" (B) significantly higher in comparison with the control treatment (methadone maintenance).

Secondary outcome analyses The secondary evaluations are carried out according to the scale levels of the variables or of the indices formed (maintenance rate, drug consumption, scene contacts, delinquency, housing situation, social contacts, quality of life, mortality rate), i. e. by bivariate or multivariate analyses.

B6.3 Sample size determination

The calculation of the sample size is based on following efficacy expectation:

• Primary outcome criterion (A) - improvement of the state of health: Efficacy expectation in control groups: ≤ 30% of responders, Efficacy expectation in experimental groups: \> 50% of responders.

• Primary outcome criterion (B) - reduction of illicit drug consumption: Efficacy expectation in control groups: ≤ 30% of responders, Efficacy expectation in experimental groups: \> 50% of responders. Within the framework of the 4 x 2-branched study design, each primary outcome criterion will be analysed by a 4-factorial logistic regression analysis. With the (conservative) assump¬tion that both target criteria are stochastically independent, a power of 90% for each main out¬come criterion guarantees that a (multiple) total power of 80% is maintained \[(1-β)2 ≈ 0.80 for β = 0.10\]. Since the total success of the study is only assumed if treatment effects are evident for both primary outcome measures, a correction of type-1-error is not necessary.

A certain number of patients will (prematurely) drop-out of treatment and not be included in the evaluation by LOCF, because they cannot be reached any more for examinations and interviews. These are patients who dropped out prior to T6 or have not started treatment or refused their consent to the investigation of the two primary outcome variables. According to the conservative evaluation strategy, these patients must be treated as ""worst cases"". Therefore, the size of the assumed effect decreases in relation to the percentage of these ""not reached"" patients in the heroin and methadone group. Realistic estimations of these percentages are 10% drop-outs in the methadone group and 5% in the heroin group. According to these expected percentages, the estimated effect size on which the calculation of the sample size is based, is reduced from 0.3 vs. 0.5 to 0.370 vs. 0.475.

Based on this assumption, a multiple total power of 80% requires a number of cases of at least N=482 test persons for each sample group (based on Chi2-test for odds ratio, sample size approximation according to Nam 1992). Related to the individual strata, this means at least four heroin and four methadone strata with at least 121 patients each are necessary to prove the expected effect with a statistical power of 80%. For practical reasons (adequate distribution to the study cen¬tres, increased measuring precision), this number is rounded up to N=140 resulting in eight strata with a total number of N=1,120 patients.

Under the described conditions, this sample size guarantees that in both tests a significant difference between methadone and heroin treatment can be proven with a statistical total power of at least 80%.

B6.4 Missing data If data of the 12-months examination are missing and concern the primary outcome criteria and cannot be replaced by the LOCF method, a non-fulfillment of the criterion must be assumed, which will be interpreted as ""worst case"" in the individual case.

B6.5 Drop-outs Patients dropping out of treatment will continue to be included in the investigations and evaluations (ITT-analysis). According to the LOCF method, the latest information of each patient will be used for the analysis if a patient cannot be interviewed at the conclusion of the study. As far as the primary outcome criterion of illicit heroin consumption is concerned, the 12-month information can only be completed by the investigation at T6, because only the five urine samples in the 6th month of treatment can be tested for illicit heroin by GC/MS. Similarly, a missing hair analysis for cocaine consumption at T12 can only be completed by a hair sample precautiously taken at T6. If no objective measure results of the primary outcome measures illicit heroin and cocaine consumption are available, the patient's self-report will be included in the analysis.

Patients who did not participate in any further investigation after the inclusion in the study are rated as ""worst case"", i.e. not reached patients of the methadone group are rated as success (responders) and not reached patients of the heroin group as failures (non-responders). Patients who died in the first phase of the study are rated (in the experimental and the control group) as non-responders. Patients, who withdraw their consent after randomisation and do not initiate the study treatment, are excluded from the ITT-analysis.",['Opioid Dependence'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

318637,NCT06207344,2025-06-30,ESTIMATED,"In one-lung ventilation surgery, compared with dexmedetomidine combined with propofol, dexmedetomidine combined with desflurane may be beneficial to accelerate patients' recovery and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications and does not increase the incidences of delirium and postoperative nausea and vomiting.","With the increase in the prevalence of lung cancer in recent years, the number of patients undergoing lobectomy has also increased. When performing lobectomy, inserting a double-lumen endotracheal tube or bronchial occlusive device and then ventilating the healthy lung is necessary. The affected lung is not ventilated; that is one-lung ventilation, which can fully expose the vision of the affected lung, provide space for surgical operation, and simultaneously avoid the pollution of the healthy lung. The emergence of one-lung ventilation has extensively promoted the development of thoracic surgery. However, during one-lung ventilation, the affected lung is not ventilated, and the blood flow of the affected lung is not oxygenated, which leads to increased intrapulmonary shunt and hypoxemia. Repeated and excessive inflation of the healthy lung may release many inflammatory factors, trigger local or systemic inflammatory reactions, and increase postoperative pulmonary complications. Therefore, it is an essential goal of anesthesia management to quickly wake up and resume spontaneous breathing to reduce mechanical ventilation time.

Propofol-based intravenous anesthesia and inhalation anesthesia with sevoflurane, isoflurane, or desflurane are clinics' most commonly used general anesthesia methods. It is found that inhalation anesthesia with desflurane is superior to propofol-based intravenous anesthesia in the aspects of eye-opening time, spontaneous breathing recovery time, and extubation time in outpatient surgery, lung volume reduction surgery, lung cancer surgery, and endoscopic lumbar disc surgery. In addition, several meta-analyses found that inhalation anesthesia has an anti-inflammatory effect compared with propofol-based anesthesia, which can reduce alveolar inflammatory reaction and postoperative pulmonary complications in patients with one-lung ventilation. Kawanishi et al. found that desflurane inhalation anesthesia can promote the collapse of the affected lung, shorten the operation time, and reduce the occurrence of atelectasis compared with propofol-based intravenous anesthesia. These studies show that inhalation anesthesia with desflurane is superior to propofol-based intravenous anesthesia in one-lung ventilation surgery.

However, inhalation anesthesia is not perfect, and studies have also found that inhalation anesthesia increases the incidences of restlessness during awakening and postoperative nausea and vomiting. One study found that the incidences of delirium, nausea and vomiting in the desflurane anesthesia group were 50% and 37.5% respectively, while that in the propofol-based intravenous anesthesia group was 10% and 17.5% respectively in lung cancer surgery. Therefore, it is necessary to explore an anesthesia management method that will not affect the advantages of inhalation anesthesia but also reduce the disadvantages of inhalation anesthesia.

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2- adrenergic receptor agonist. Its primary function is sedation, often used as an anesthetic adjuvant. Studies have found that dexmedetomidine can significantly reduce the incidences of delirium during recovery and postoperative nausea and vomiting. In patients undergoing nasal surgery, dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of delirium in patients receiving desflurane anesthesia from 52.8% to 5.6%, even lower than the incidence of delirium (10%) in patients receiving propofol in lung cancer surgery. In patients undergoing laparoscopic hysterectomy, the use of dexmedetomidine can reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting after desflurane anesthesia from 32% to 13%, even lower than that after propofol anesthesia in lung cancer surgery (17.5%). In addition, dexmedetomidine can reduce inflammatory reactions, improve oxidative stress and respiratory mechanics, reduce intrapulmonary shunt, improve oxygenation, and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications in one-lung ventilation surgery. Although dexmedetomidine has a sedative effect, this sedative effect can be awakened easily. Moreover, a meta-analysis found that dexmedetomidine did not prolong the stay time in the anesthesia recovery room but only prolonged extubation time statistically, and it had no clinical significance. In a word, a large number of meta-analyses found that dexmedetomidine can not only reduce the incidence of various adverse events after operation but also has no noticeable effect on patients' recovery.

Therefore, the investigators speculate that compared with dexmedetomidine combined with propofol, dexmedetomidine combined with desflurane is beneficial to accelerate patients' recovery and reduce postoperative pulmonary complications and does not increase the incidences of delirium and postoperative nausea and vomiting.","['Anesthesia Recovery Period', 'Postoperative Complications']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

HIV infection is closely linked to the growth of the HIV virus in the body. Much of this information was obtained from studying how the HIV virus grows in circulating blood. Recent studies have shown that the lymphoid tissue (part of the immune system) is a major site where HIV is found in the body and is also where much of the HIV virus growth occurs. This study will examine not only blood but also lymphoid tissue to gain a better understanding of the disease and how to treat it.","The natural history and pathogenesis of HIV-1 infection are linked closely to the replication of virus in the body. Studies obtained entirely from analyses of peripheral blood led to a shift in the understanding of HIV-1 pathogenesis. Recent studies have shown that lymphoid tissues are a major reservoir for HIV and the primary site of virus replication. The proposed studies will provide the first comprehensive assessment of HIV-1 expression and lymphocyte response in both blood and lymphocyte tissue compartments. The data obtained will provide new insight into HIV-1 pathogenesis and provide a more rational basis for treatment decisions concerning early therapy of HIV-1 infection.

This is a prospective, single-institution, parallel-group, single-blinded, randomized-controlled, two-arm, effectiveness study comparing bupivacaine liposomal injectable suspension (Exparel®) versus regular bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCl).

Procedure:

In patients aged 18 and over who require sternotomy, thoracotomy, mini-thoracotomy, or laparotomy incisions will be screened and consented for potential enrollment. Patients will be randomized following consenting to either Exparel® or regular bupivacaine hydrochloride group.

Course of Study:

The study will accrue patients over the course of 4 years.

Enrollment:

Enrollment will consist of all adult patients aged 18 and over undergoing surgical procedures requiring sternotomy, thoracotomy, mini-thoracotomy, or laparotomy incisions. Patients will be screened and consented preoperatively. If the patient is deemed eligible and consents to participate, randomization will occur and the patient will be considered enrolled.

Recruitment:

The target for enrollment will be 280 patients (the study target sample size per power analysis, but actual enrollment will be greater (330 patients) to account for exclusions for various reasons in order to achieve the target recruitment).

Risks:

There is a small increased risk to the patients by participating in the study in addition to a possible chance of breach in patient confidentiality as the study involves evaluation of an FDA-approved drug. As detailed in the informed consent, the subjects are at risk of developing adverse effects from Exparel®, described on the drug packet insert and from HCl Bupivacaine, also described on the drug packet insert. The investigators do not expect any additional physical risks other than an unintentional disclosure of sensitive patient health information.

Data Safety Monitoring:

As the Principal Investigator of this study, Dr. Charlton-Ouw from the Department of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Surgery at The University of Texas at Houston Medical School will conduct the data safety monitoring of this study. He will annually meet with all other co-investigators to review the patients enrolled in this study. As part of the data safety monitoring plan, all patients enrolled until that point in time would be unblinded in order to review the outcomes. Additionally, in view of the uncertainty attached to the treatment effects in this heterogeneous population, owing to limited currently available data, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Committee, will oversee the progress of the trial.

200519,NCT00209209,2018-12,ESTIMATED,"The aim of this study is to answer the following independent questions in the treatment of mantle cell lymphomas:

* Can rituximab-fludarabine, cyclophosphamide (R-FC) improve the reduction of lymphoma mass compared to rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (R-CHOP) and so become a new standard for initial cytoreductive therapy?
* Can maintenance with rituximab substitute the interferon maintenance and even improve the progression free survival in patients after successful initial cytoreductive therapy?","This study investigates two independent questions in the treatment of elderly patients with mantle cell lymphomas:

1. To test in elderly patients with advanced mantle cell lymphoma, whether rituximab plus a combination of fludarabine with cyclophosphamide (6 FC cycles) results in a higher reduction of lymphoma mass measured by the percentage of CR than rituximab combined with the standard chemotherapy scheme (8 CHOP cycles).
2. To compare maintenance therapy with rituximab with maintenance with interferon-alpha or pegylated interferon for progression free survival, after 2 different regimens of induction chemo-immunotherapy in elderly patients with mantle cell lymphoma.

This study will be performed as a prospective, randomized, open-label multicenter phase III trial. All patients will be randomized for an initial cytoreductive therapy with R-FC or R-CHOP.

The parameter for the comparison of R-FC and R-CHOP will be the percentage of complete remissions after initial cytoreductive therapy. According to the known results of R-FC and R-CHOP in lymphoma therapy, a relevant difference between R-CHOP and R-FC in the overall response rates is not expected. For both therapies an overall response rate of about 90% is expected. Since it is well known that the prognosis of patients who do not reach at least a PR in the initial therapy is very poor, it will be also necessary to control this parameter during the study. If an unexpected relevant difference in the overall response rates is observed during the study, the initial randomisation should be stopped and all patients should be assigned to the superior therapy. In this case the CR rates will not be important for the choice of the initial therapy. If no relevant differences in the overall response rates are observed, a one sided Fisher test will be performed at the end of the recruitment to test whether the rate of CR's after R-FC is significantly improved compared to R-CHOP.

The statistical parameters for controlling the overall response rates and for testing the CR rates are chosen in the following way: The working significance level for all statistical evaluations in this part of the study will be set to alpha=0.05. The expected CR rate after R-CHOP is according to the observations about 50%; a clinical relevant improvement by R-FC would be a CR rate of 65%. Such an improvement should be detected by the one sided Fisher test with a power of about 95%. According to these parameters about 246 observations for each treatment would be necessary. To control the overall response rates, a difference of 85% to 95% will be clinically so relevant that initial randomisation should be terminated with a probability of about 95%. Overall response rates will be controlled by a restricted sequential procedure.

Patients achieving at least a partial remission after R-FC or R-CHOP will be randomised for interferon maintenance versus rituximab maintenance in order to evaluate the impact of maintenance therapy in progression free survival.

The improvement expected by the new maintenance with rituximab for progression free survival can be expressed by reduction of relative risk (rr). Since a risk reduction to 60% was observed for indolent lymphomas by interferon maintenance, this seems to be a clinical relevant improvement for the new maintenance therapy. For a working significance level alpha=0.05 and a power of 95% the number of events (relapse or death) necessary for a two sided fixed sample trial is about 200. During this study the progression free survival in patients after successful initial therapy will be monitored by an equivalent restricted sequential procedure with a maximum number of 240 observation.

In order to evaluate the impact of initial therapy and maintenance therapy on overall survival in this patients, a total follow up of about 15 years for this study is expected.","['Lymphoma, Mantle-Cell']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The present study is part of a cooperation project between the SC Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico (Milan, Italy), the University of Milan, the University of Parma and Rome Tor Vergata, funded under the call for Research Projects of Significant National Interest - 2022 PNRR Call (Prot. P2022WEXP2).

Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a defective RNA virus, which requires the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) to infect liver cells and propagate. To date, the mechanisms underlying the accelerated disease progression in the natural history of Delta hepatitis are poorly understood, as is the course of the HDV-specific immune response (CD4 and CD8 T cells). As in chronic HBV and HCV infections, the outcome of chronic HDV infection appears to be dictated primarily by the host immune response, which represents a key determinant for virus control or persistence. For HBV/HDV coinfection, the role of T cells has not been well defined, as suitable animal models are lacking and so far few HDV-specific T cell epitopes have been precisely mapped, mainly limited to HLA-B alleles.

The study is divided into two substudies (cross-sectional and longitudinal). The primary objective of the cross-sectional study is to calculate the prevalence of HDV-specific T responses in patients with chronic HBV-HDV infection naïve to treatment with Bulevirtide. The primary objective of the longitudinal study is the change in the prevalence of HDV-specific T responses in patients with chronic HBV-HDV infection during treatment with Bulevirtide compared to baseline (pre-treatment).",,['Hepatitis D'],OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

326323,NCT01630629,2015-09,ACTUAL,"Changes in maternal calcium metabolism are necessary during lactation to provide adequate calcium in breast milk for development of the newborn skeleton. The calcium in milk is derived from the maternal skeleton, resulting in significant bone loss, a process thought to be mediated by the actions of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in combination with a decreased estrogen levels. After weaning, bone lost during lactation is rapidly regained.

Differences between African-American and Caucasian bone metabolism are well documented and include higher bone mineral density (BMD), lower risk of fragility fracture, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH) D), and higher PTH in African-Americans compared to Caucasians. Most studies of bone metabolism in lactating women have been done in Caucasians. Because of differences in bone metabolism between African-Americans and Caucasians, we do not know whether African-Americans will have similar findings.

The primary aim of this study is to compare the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) during lactation in African-Americans with those in Caucasians. It is not known whether the loss in BMD during lactation will be the same for both races. African-Americans display skeletal resistance to PTH with short-term infusions and have lower bone resorption, higher BMD and lower fracture risk than Caucasians. A recent study by our group indicated that lactating African-American mothers had slightly lower bone resorption but quantitatively similar bone formation compared to Caucasians. However, there was a significant increase of 2-3 fold in markers of bone formation and resorption in both groups. Therefore, it is currently not known whether the loss in BMD during lactation will be the same for both races. Primary outcome measures in this study will include spine, hip and radius BMD by Dual X-Ray Absorbiometry (DXA)Scans during lactation (at 2,12 and 24 weeks postpartum or at weaning if prior to 24 weeks postpartum, and six months after weaning (+1 week). This longitudinal protocol will distinguish between two hypotheses. Either: a) as measured by BMD, bone loss in African-Americans during lactation will be equal to that in Caucasians, and skeletal recovery will be the same or possibly accelerated compared to Caucasians; or, b) African-Americans will be resistant to bone loss during lactation compared to Caucasians because of resistance to Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein (PTHrP).","Pregnancy and lactation are both states of altered maternal calcium metabolism. Maternal calcium mobilization is essential in the provision of an adequate calcium supply to the developing fetus and infant. During pregnancy approximately 30 grams of calcium is required for fetal skeletal development. The extra calcium is derived mostly from increased maternal intestinal absorption, mediated by 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1). During lactation, it is estimated that 600-1000 ml of milk are produced daily with a net maternal calcium loss of 200-400 mg per day (2,3). This calcium is derived from the maternal skeleton, resulting in bone loss of as much as 10% of trabecular bone with serial bone density measurements (3). Demineralization is thought to be mediated predominantly by the actions of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) in combination with a suppressed estrogen state. Interestingly, this state rapidly reverses itself with weaning (4,5). Several studies have shown that initial PTHrP measurements are significantly higher in lactating women(3). PTHrP in lactation is produced in high amounts by the mammary gland. Once in the circulation, PTHrP increases bone resorption from the maternal skeleton and increases calcium resorption at the level of the kidney (5,6,27). PTHrP levels have been found to be elevated as much as 10,000 fold in milk as compared with maternal serum, and further increase with suckling (1,6,28). In mouse models, tissue specific-ablation of the PTHrP gene in lactating mammary gland results in decreased bone loss(6).

Given the rapid bone loss reported in lactation, an increase in markers of bone resorption and a decrease in markers of bone formation might be expected. However, a recently published study by our group showed that both markers of bone formation and bone resorption were significantly elevated in lactating Caucasian women (7). This seems unlikely as tight coupling of bone formation and resorption would not result in net calcium mobilization and rapid bone loss during lactation. A more likely explanation is that while bone resorption markers accurately reflect robust osteoclastic bone resorption, the increase in markers of bone formation reflects an increase in immature, partially differentiated pre-osteoblasts that are arrested in development and therefore unable to effectively form new bone. Thus, the rate of resorption exceeds that of formation during lactation and results in a temporary net loss. To support this idea, rat studies have shown that continuous exposure to PTH and PTHrP recruits and initiates osteoblast differentiation, but stops the program prematurely at the preosteoblast transition (8,9,10). This would also suggest a mechanism for the rapid recovery seen after weaning: after withdrawing the PTHrP stimulus, osteoclast-mediated bone resorption would abruptly cease, and previously recruited osteoblast precursors would rapidly complete their differentiation program and restore bone lost during lactation.

African-American bone metabolism differs from Caucasian bone metabolism in several ways. African-Americans display higher bone density and are at lower risk of developing osteoporosis and osteoporotic fracture compared to Caucasians (15-17,29-31). There are may factors which may explain these racial differences in bone metabolism, including altered calcium economy, vitamin D differences, peak attained bone mass, muscle mass and obesity, remodeling rates, bone micro-architecture, hip axis geometry , and other unknown hereditary differences. In particular, it is well established that 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH D) levels are much lower in African-Americans, due to darker pigmentation resulting in reduced dermal production of 25-OH D as well as reduced intake of vitamin D (11). This hypovitaminosis results in a relative secondary hyperparathyroidism, corroborated by higher levels of PTH and 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D as well as decreased urinary calcium excretion (12-14). Paradoxically, these higher PTH levels do not correlate with an increase in bone loss. In fact, bone turnover is actually reduced compared to Caucasians, suggesting that African-American bones are more resistant to the effects of PTH, whereas renal sensitivity is maintained or increased (14,18).

The vast majority of studies examining bone metabolism in lactating women have been in Caucasian women. Studies on bone turnover and calcitropic hormones in lactating African-Americans are scarce. Over ten years ago, a study examined markers of bone metabolism in a population of lactating Gambian women (in Gambia) and compared them with a similar cohort of British lactating women (in the UK). The study demonstrated significant increases in older markers of bone formation and resorption during lactation, but also showed higher levels of PTH, 1,25 Vitamin D, serum phosphate, osteocalcin, and alkaline phosphatase in the Gambian lactating population compared with the British lactating population (19). However, Gambian women differ significantly from black women in the developed world in terms of nutrition, both overall calories and calcium intake. Also in contrast to African-Americans, black Gambian women displayed lower BMD than Caucasians. Interestingly, in these studies, Gambian women demonstrated significant losses in whole body and hip BMD during lactation and showed little evidence of bone mass regain after weaning. In fact, Gambian women had continued BMD loss at the hip, in contrast to Caucasian controls.

A recent study by our group (unpublished) explored bone turnover markers and calcium metabolism in African-American lactation. Markers of bone resorption were lower in African-American than Caucasians in non-lactating young women, but increased 2-3 fold in both groups during lactation. Baseline bone formation was comparable in African-Americans and Caucasians, also increasing 2-3 fold in both groups. Fractional excretion of calcium was lower in African-Americans at baseline and remained constant in both groups during lactation. It remains unclear whether bone loss occurs at a similar rate during lactation in the African-American population.

Up to this point, there have been no studies in African-Americans that have utilized bone densitometry to quantitate bone loss and recovery during lactation. This study aims to demonstrate changes in bone density in African-American women during the high bone turnover state of lactation. It will also permit measurements of calcium metabolism, markers of bone formation and resorption, and calcitropic hormones to be compared to bone density changes. We will also look for racial differences in lactating bone metabolism by directly comparing a cohort of African-American lactating women with a similar Caucasian cohort. No prior studies have been done comparing bone mineral density changes in lactating American black and Caucasian women.","['Lactation', 'Other Disorders of Bone Density and Structure', 'Endocrine; Complications']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The study had utilized two methods of enteral feeding consisted of intermittent enteral feeding by syringe pump and hospital blended enteral feeding by feeding bag and assess the patient before and after feeding for 10 days by using three tools help to monitor hemodynamic parameters, GIT system assessment and laboratory findings assessment which help to evaluate nutritional status and complications. The results showed that the complications in the intermittent enteral feeding group were lower than those in feeding bag group.","Introduction Enteral nutritional support refers to the provision of calories, protein, electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, trace elements, and fluids via the gastrointestinal route. Enteral feeding is indicated for patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract whose oral nutritional intake is insufficient to meet estimated needs .

Enteral nutrition therapy has a number of advantages over par-enteral nutrition in the management of patients requiring nutritional support. Enteral nutrition aids in the preservation of gastrointestinal function by the provision of enteral nutrients and is easier, safer and less costly to administer .

However, despite these relative advantages, the delivery of safe and effective enteral nutrition therapy may still present challenges for families and caregivers in terms of time, technical expertise, and cost .

Due to advances in technology of enteral feeding tubes and delivery systems, specialization of health professionals, and better education of parents and caregivers, the administration of enteral nutrition has been associated with improved clinical outcome and safety profiles. Enteral nutrition therapy is easier and safer to administer than is par-enteral nutrition. Not only are the risks of intravenous access avoided, but there is also a wider margin for error with most metabolic complications. As a result, enteral nutrition therapy is easier to administer in low-intensity hospitals and patient care settings, including the home. However, compared with normal diet, tube feedings require extra time and effort to administer and this additional care need may contribute to increased burden and stress for families and caregivers .

This study was designed as a randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of intermittent enteral feeding by using syringe pump versus hospital blended feeding by using feeding bag on the nutritional status and complications among ICU patients.

Methods Design Structured as a randomized-controlled prospective study, the objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of intermittent enteral feeding by using syringe pump versus hospital blended formula by using feeding bag on reducing complications and improving the nutritional status of patients the intensive care units.

Setting Data was collected from assiut university hospitals .

Sample The study population consisted of patients eighteen to sixty years old, hospitalized and treated in critical and trauma intensive care units. The inclusion criteria stipulated that the patient was between eighteen and sixty years old; both genders were included; patients with a functional gastrointestinal tract and poor oral nutritional intake and agreed to participate in the study. A power calculation estimated that in order to detect an effect size of 11.8 difference in mean of protein level between the two studied groups, with a p-value \< 0.05 and 80% power, confidence level 0.95, a sample size of 22 patients for each group was needed. However, 60 patients were attempted in this research work to avoid non-response rate (30 for each group). This calculated using G Power 3.1 . The study data was collected between June 2019 and December 2019.

Instruments and measurements Three tools used in this study were developed by the researcher based on reviewing of the literature. The first tool was general assessment sheet used to monitor hemodynamic parameters included (Mean arterial pressure (MAP) taken from bed side monitor, heart rate (HR), temperature, respiratory rate and CVP readings, physical examination done every day and included neurological examination and chest examination regarding disturbances, chest x-ray assessment, mode of ventilation and duration of mechanical ventilation, fluid balance assessment., assessment of laboratory findings in addition to socio-demographic and medical data.

The second tool is feeding assessment sheet was developed by the researcher and used to assess BMI after assessing height and weight; assessment of amount of water, protein, calories was given per day; assessment of mode of enteral feeding ; residual volume assessment; period of feeding rest and frequency .

The third tool is Patients' outcomes evaluation sheet which was developed by the researcher and used to assess patients' outcomes and complications . .

Intervention After getting ethical clearance patients were enrolled in the study, patients were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Following an initial assessment, the patients were assigned to one of the two groups by block randomization.

Both groups received 3000 ml of feed per day and the same formula per day which was 30-35 ml/kg of water, 0.8 g/kg of protein and 2000 k cal of calories for females and 2500 K cal for males. The only manipulation was in the flow rate and the device which the feed was administered.

Intermittent enteral feeding group received intermittent feeding as the feed was given over a 24 hour period with intervals of rest (e.g. three hours feeding two hours rest) by using syringe pump and Feeds were administered according to guidelines as the head of the patient's bed was elevated at least 30 degrees from the horizontal before initiating feeding, the feeding schedule was started at a rate of 50 ml/hr in adults to promote tolerance,the administration rate of isotonic formulas increased in 20-25 ml/hr increments every eight hours until the desired rate was achieved, the tube was flushed regularly with 20 to 30 ml of warm water every four hours during continuous feeding and before and after intermittent feeding and medication administration, the gastric residual volume was checked every 4-6 hr routinely Feeding bag group received hospital blended formula which was 300 ml of feeds every 24 hrs with 4 hrs rest at night and given in 10 minutes with following the same guidelines in the intermittent enteral feeding group.

Data collection The data were collected from the first day of admission after stabilization of the patient's condition and extended to 7 days, every day then the data were recorded in the developed tools.The researcher assigned study sample (30 patients) to two groups (intermittent enteral feeding group, feeding bag group).

For intermittent enteral feeding group: The researcher assessed patients who were receiving intermittent enteral feeding. For feeding bag group: The researcher assessed patients who received hospital blended formula.

Ethical considerations Approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the faculty of nursing with no risk for study subject during application of the study as the study followed common ethical principles in clinical research and written consent was obtained from patients or guidance that participated in the study after explaining the nature and purpose of the study.

Patient was assured that the data of this research was not be reused without second permission, confidentiality and anonymity was assured and the patients had the right to refuse to participate or withdraw from the study without any rational at any time.

Clinical synergism has also been described between gefitinib and vinorelbine in NSCLC. The use of cytotoxics in a metronomic schedule has not been well investigated in the clinical setting despite emerging pre-clinical data. Using an established oral cytotoxic such as oral vinorelbine in a metronomic dose-schedule is attractive due to the oral route of administration. Preclinical studies have shown that by using cytotoxics in a low-dose protracted manner, endothelial cells are preferentially affected via inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In addition to this anti-angiogenic mechanism, an anti-vasculogenic process may also be involved that acts by reducing circulating endothelial progenitor mobilization and viability. Moreover, it has also been shown that tumours that were selected for high levels of acquired resistance to cytotoxics can be induced to respond by using metronomic doses of chemotherapy.

Continuous administration of metronomic oral vinorelbine, given three times a week, has been reported as feasible and well tolerated at doses up to 180 mg total dose per week.

There has been no previous randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of daily SSRI in the first three months after stroke on improvement of language in people undergoing aphasia treatment. It is plausible that SSRIs, which elevate synaptic serotonin, might enhance recovery by augmenting synaptic plasticity.

The investigators propose to conduct a Phase 2 multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram for augmenting language intervention in subacute stroke. The investigators hypothesize that daily escitalopram for 90 days after stroke results in greater improvement (compared to placebo) in naming untrained pictures, as well as greater increase in content of picture description and greater improvement in morphosyntactic production, when combined with speech and language treatment (SALT). A second aim is to evaluate the mechanisms of language recovery in individuals who receive active medical treatment and those who receive placebo, using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and genetic testing. The investigators hypothesize that greater improvement in language is associated with increased connectivity within the left hemisphere language network on rsfMRI in participants who receive escitalopram than in those who receive placebo, independently of improvement in depression. The investigators also hypothesize that the effects are greatest in individuals with val/val allele of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) - (consistent with previous studies showing a greater response to treatment and greater neuroplasticity in people with the val/val allele than those with one or more met alleles.","['Aphasia', 'Stroke']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

408854,NCT05826119,2024-06-15,ESTIMATED,"In our study, it was aimed to show the contribution of intraoperative intravenous magnesium sulfate administration to peroperative opioid consumption and postoperative analgesia.","Postsurgical pain is one of the most important issues that could impress on postoperative peace and comfort. Laparoscopic hysterectomy associated with intense inflammatory response, resulting in moderate to severe postoperative pain perception The major goal in postoperative pain management is to minimize the dose of medications and lessen side effects, while still providing adequate analgesia. Postoperative pain relief leads to earlier mobilization, shortened hospital staying, reduced hospital costs, and increased patient satisfaction Narcotics are the most common analgesics which are used after the surgeries. But anesthetists are always looking for replaceable methods with fewer side effects and cost . It seems adjuvant analgesics are those desirable replacements. Nowadays there have been many debates on the role of adjuvant analgesics on postoperative pain relief. One way to use adjuvant analgesics is preventive method Preventive analgesia is a method initiated before anesthetic procedure in order to reduce the physiological consequences of nociceptive stimulation and medical adverse effects and has been defined as an antinociceptive treatment that prevents establishment of altered central processing of afferent input from injuries. One of the intravenous adjuvant that has been shown potential in preventive analgesia is magnesium sulfate that could be administered with multiple routes or methods Mg has been used for many years in anesthesia and cardiology as an anticonvulsant or antiarrhythmic drug. The mechanism of the analgesic effect of Mg is not clear but interference with calcium channels and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor seem to play an important role. It seems that analgesic mechanism of NMDA-antagonists is made by preventing nociceptive central sensitization. Another suggesting mechanism is the role of it on reduction of catecholamine release with sympathetic stimulation, thereby decreasing peripheral nociception or the stress response to the surgery. Data illustrate that the NMDA receptor antagonists ""like Mg sulfate"" have an effect on pain threshold and could prevent pain perception even with low doses (preventive doses) In our study, investigators aimed to determine the contribution of magnesium sulfate to postoperative analgesia in abdominal hysterectomy by considering its mechanism of action.

The patients were divided into two groups as magnesium sulfate administered and non-administered The magnesium group received a bolus of 20 mg/kg of magnesium sulfate in 100 mL of saline for 15 minutes before induction, followed by a continuous infusion of 20 mg/kg/hr until the skin was closed.

PLATINUM-CAN is a parallel collaborative trial linked with the sister trial PLATINUM led by Oxford University. Given the rapidly evolving epidemic and important differences in healthcare contexts and public health systems between countries that could impact the number of cases and access to diagnosis and treatment, a Canadian study is warranted to assess the feasibility and acceptability of conducting large scale interventional monkeypox trials in Canada. Such a focused trial also allows for the opportunity to explore a number of secondary objectives that can address concerns raised during consultation with Canadian community members (e.g., resolution of pain, quality of life) and validate use of self-assessed primary outcomes using blinded photography assessment.

The trial is pragmatic and minimizes number of visits, tests performed and contacts with the healthcare system through use of self-assessment diaries and self-testing. Lesion and/or throat swabs taken as part of standard care will be sent for detection of monkeypox virus DNA by PCR to local public health/provincial laboratories for initial screening (using panorthopox DNA testing) and confirmation with monkeypox specific PCR either locally or by National Microbiology Laboratory. The protocol allows for a broad range of patients to be enrolled. The trial has been designed so that it can accommodate patients who may be assessed in a variety of medical settings (e.g., hospital emergency rooms, outpatient HIV and infectious diseases clinics, community sexual health clinics, primary care, or through public health services).

The trial is designed to assess the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of VACCINE RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT(HDT-301), which is a novel Lipid-Inorganic Nanoparticle (LION) formulated replicating RNA-based vaccine that encodes for a full-length spike (S) protein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. As a replicating mRNA vaccine, VACCINE RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT(HDT-301) has the potential to allow the advantages of dose sparing, and possibly administration as a single dose, compared with other mRNA platforms.

Enrollment will occur at one domestic site. A total of 90 healthy subjects will receive multiple dosages of intramuscular (IM) injections of VACCINE RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT(HDT-301). Participants will be enrolled sequentially in three dose cohorts (cohort 1 = 1 µg, cohort 2 = 5 µg, and cohort 3 = 25 µg), with each cohort consisting of a total of 30 subjects. Within each dose cohort, participants will be randomized (4:1 ratio for active vaccine:placebo) with equal probability of receiving a schedule of two doses, of the same concentration, on days 1 and 28 (group 1) or 1 and 56 (group 2), or a schedule of single dose administration (group 3) VACCINE RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT(HDT-301). The main objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of 3 dose vaccination schedule of VACCINE RNA MCTI CIMATEC HDT(HDT-301) and 1 dose of placebo in healthy adults.

Safety and tolerability will be the primary endpoint assessed by incidence of adverse events for each dose through 12 months after the vaccination. Scheduled interim immunogenicity evaluations will be conducted for pre-specified timepoints as secundary and exploratory endpoints.","In this phase 1 dose-ranging study, 3 dosage cohorts (1 µg, 5 µg, 25 µg), 90 subjects will be randomized (4:1 ratio for active vaccine:placebo) with equal probability of receiving a two-dose schedule of the same concentration, 28 days (group 1) or 56 days (group 2 ) after the first dose, or, a single dose schedule (group 3). For each of the three cohorts, for safety reasons, 1 sentinel subject will be registered initially, and will be vaccinated with the experimental drug, and will be followed up until day 8 (seven days after the first dose). If any criterion for interruption does not occur by day 8, 4 more sentinel subjects will be recruited and included in the study.

This means that once the first sentinel subject must receive the study vaccine, of the 4 sentinel participants enrolled later, 3 will receive the vaccine and 1 will receive the placebo (0.9% sodium chloride solution). Only then, after the 7-day follow-up period of the last sentinel subject, if no stopping rule is identified, the recruitment and registration of the remaining 25 subjects will proceed.

After cohort 1 has been registered, cohort 2 will be registered in a similar manner, with the first sentinel subject being registered after a 7-day observation period followed by the vaccination of the last subject in cohort 1. Cohort 3 will be registered in a similar manner after cohort 2.

There is a placebo group in each cohort in order to compare and improve the assessment of causality of adverse events.

183271,NCT03610100,2022-12,ESTIMATED,"The primary purpose of this study is to assess whether Acelarin (NUC-1031) is superior to gemcitabine in terms of overall survival for treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic carcinoma. In addition disease progression, quality of life and comparative safety will be evaluated. Secondary objectives are to compare between the two treatment groups the following:

* Progression Free Survival (PFS)
* Radiological Response and disease control rate
* Toxicity and safety
* Quality of Life

Additional, exploratory objectives are to discover and validate possible biomarkers to predict additional benefit of Acelarin (NUC-1031) over gemcitabine alone.","Pancreatic cancer remains the most lethal of solid tumours with little progress being made to improve patient outcomes over the past 30 years of research. The incidence in the UK is approximately 9,000 new cases per year and, with a 5 year survival remaining at just 3%, mortality approximates incidence. These dismal outcomes reflect:

1. Advanced stage at presentation such that only a minority of patients are suitable for surgery with curative intent;
2. High rates of recurrence even in those undergoing radical surgery;
3. Limited efficacy of systemic therapies.

   Until recently, the mainstay of systemic therapy for advanced pancreatic cancer was gemcitabine, based on the pivotal study in 1997 by Burris et al., reporting a survival and clinical benefit when compared with 5-FU. However, this benefit is modest with median and 1-year survival of approximately 6 months and 20% respectively for patients with metastatic disease. Combination chemotherapy has shown more promising results but at the expense of significant toxicity limiting this to younger patients with good performance status.

   Although these chemotherapy combinations confer a survival advantage over gemcitabine, their use is restricted to a cohort of patients able, and willing, to tolerate additional toxicity. Pancreatic cancer is commonly associated with:

   (i) increasing age; (ii) co-morbidities (for example, diabetes mellitus which, if associated with peripheral neuropathy, may limit the safe administration of neurotoxic drugs such as oxaliplatin and nab-paclitaxel); (iii) symptoms that negatively impact on performance status; (iv) biliary obstruction requiring stenting, with associated risks of sepsis and impaired drug metabolism.

   Thus, for a large proportion of patients single agent gemcitabine remains an appropriate standard chemotherapy. For this group of patients, more efficacious and better tolerated treatment is required.

   The study is being performed to investigate whether Acelarin provides improvement in overall survival compared with gemcitabine. This is a pivotal study in this indication and will represent the landmark data for whether there is additional benefit from Acelarin in pancreatic cancer.

   Gemcitabine monotherapy, the control arm, remains a standard of care in this disease. The only treatments that have shown improved outcome over gemcitabine are Folfirinox and nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine. However, the application of these regimens to a large proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer is limited by the potential for significant toxicities.

   Acelarin (NUC-1031) is a first-in-class nucleotide analogue, which uses novel phosphoramidate technology to overcome the key cancer resistance mechanisms associated with gemcitabine.

   Acelarin is synthesised as a pre-activated molecule bearing one protected phosphate group, termed the phosphoramidate motif, imparting several potential advantages to this new agent over gemcitabine:
   * Acelarin (NUC-1031) overcomes the reliance on nucleoside transporters to cross the cellular membrane for effective uptake by the cancer cells.
   * Acelarin (NUC-1031) presents the cell with an already partially activated (monophosphate) form of the nucleoside, thereby obviating the need for the rate limiting initial kinase activation.
   * Acelarin (NUC-1031) is protected from enzymatic breakdown (especially by deaminases and phosphorylases) resulting in greater stability and a reduction in the generation of toxic metabolites.

   The clinical relevance of these resistance mechanisms has been well documented.

   Multiple active nucleoside transporters located in the cell membrane carry out the transport of nucleoside analogues, such as gemcitabine, into the cells. The human equilibrative nucleoside transporter, hENT1 mediates the majority of gemcitabine uptake. It is therefore expected that hENT1-deficient cells are highly resistant to gemcitabine (Achiwa et al., Cancer Sci. 2004).

   Nucleoside transport deficiency is an important predictive factor for gemcitabine response in patients with cancer. Spratlin et al.,demonstrated that the presence of nucleoside transporters correlated with improved response to gemcitabine and OS in patients with pancreatic cancer (Spratlin et al Clin Cancer Res. 2004). Patients expressing hENT1 had a median survival of 13 months compared to only 4 months in patients with little or no hENT1 activity.

   Acelarin has been shown to overcome the need for hENT1 active transport to enter the cancer cells. The greater lipophilicity allows Acelarin to cross the cell membrane independently of nucleoside transporters.

   To become active, nucleoside analogues require sequential steps of phosphorylation within the cancer cells. Deficiency in dCK is a frequently described form of in-vitro and in-vivo inherent as well as acquired resistance to gemcitabine. Acelarin is synthesised as a monophosphate agent and, as such, has by-passed the rate limiting step of kinase-dependent activation.

   Acelarin bears a phosphoramidate moiety on the ribose 5' carbon, which protects the compound from deamination (Slusarczyk et al J Med Chem 2014) , which may confer considerable survival advantages and a more favourable safety profile (Ghazali et al JCO 322:5s, 2014).

   It is planned to perform this study in approximately 40 UK centres with additional centres in Europe and the USA with a centre defined as the primary institution of the clinical investigator. Recruitment will be competitive and 328 patients will be randomised in a 1:1 fashion.

   Randomisation will be stratified by ECOG performance status (PS) (0/1 vs 2).

   Baseline radiographic assessment of disease will be performed within 28 days prior to first treatment and first treatment will be delivered within 8 days of randomisation or the earliest screening procedure, e.g. blood samples, CT scan whichever is sooner as follows:

   Arm A (experimental arm): Acelarin (NUC-1031)

   Acelarin: 825 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 15 to 30 minutes on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle

   Arm B (standard therapeutic arm): Gemcitabine

   Gemcitabine: 1000mg/m2 administered intravenously as a 30 minute infusion on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle

   Patients will be seen on a weekly basis during the time they are on active treatment and will be treated until disease progression. At the completion of therapy, an end-of therapy visit must be completed within 7 days after the decision is made to discontinue all therapy. This must be a full assessment consisting of physical exam, Performance Status, ECG, haematology and chemistry profile and toxicity/AE assessments, after which follow up will then occur every 12 weeks. CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will take place at screening then every 12 weeks thereafter until disease progression as per RECIST 1.1.

   No further anti-tumour treatment will be initiated until progression of disease. AE information will be collected until at least 30 days after the last dose of study therapy is administered or until all study therapy-related AEs have resolved, stabilised or been deemed irreversible and a 30 day safety follow up should be performed at this point.

   A phase I/II clinical study has established the RP2D and schedule for Acelarin as 825 mg/m2 administered intravenously on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle. Two dose limiting toxicities were observed (grade 3 transaminitis at 725mg/m2 and grade 4 thrombocytopenia at 750mg/m2). Otherwise treatment was well-tolerated with no unexpected adverse events. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate with the most common grade 1 and 2 AEs being anaemia, fatigue, transaminitis and thrombocytopenia. Only three patients experienced grade 4 AEs: thrombocytopenia, hypomagnesaemia and sepsis.

   The following precautionary measures will also be put in place:
   * Assessment of full blood count, renal function and liver function will be made prior to each administration of Acelarin.
   * The occurrence of haematological toxicity including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia which requires dose adjustment is specified in the protocol.
   * The effect of renal impairment on exposure to Acelarin in patients with renal impairment is not known. Therefore study entry is restricted to patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 30mL/minute.
   * Acelarin should not be administered to pregnant women. A negative pregnancy test should be confirmed before administration of Acelarin for all women of childbearing age.
   * There is no known antidote for Acelarin, and treatment of AEs associated with its use should be for the underlying adverse symptoms.
   * Since Acelarin will be reconstituted in specialist oncology pharmacies and administered by experienced chemotherapy-trained nurses via intravenous injection, overdose is considered to be highly unlikely. There is no specific treatment for an overdose of Acelarin. In case of overdose, therapy may be interrupted, and any adverse reactions treated symptomatically.

   Assessment of full blood count, renal function and liver function will be made prior to each administration of gemcitabine.

   The occurrence of haematological toxicity including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia which requires dose adjustment is specified in the protocol.","['Pancreatic Acinar Carcinoma', 'Pancreatic Neoplasms']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

443546,NCT03705637,2020-03-24,ACTUAL,"Burn injuries are painful to patients and the sources of pain result from many areas including: the injury itself, wound care, and surgery. Inpatients that require surgical skin grafting is often required and the donor site of a skin graft is quite painful for patients. The investigators try to minimize that pain with local anesthetic as well as a combination of pain medications, the donor site pain lasts for days and is what patients often report as being the most painful part of their burn care.

There has been the development of a new form of local anesthesia that can last up to 72 hours when injected into tissue. Based on encouraging results in the literature in areas outside of burns, this study aims to evaluate whether administration of this medication at the time of surgery can help improve pain for burn patients in the postoperative period.","Patients suffer from pain resulting from the injury, wound care, and surgical treatment of their burns. As a result, they often require considerable amounts of narcotics. Given the concern for opiate addiction and the national opiate crisis the investigators have tried to explore other non-opiate means of pain control. One of the newest methods for pain relief is with liposomal bupivacaine, which can provide local analgesia for up to 72 hours at the site of injection. This medication has been used with good effect in multiple contexts.

Skin graft donor sites are the most painful portion of their surgical treatment and the pain typically is most severe during the first few days after surgery. For this reason, the investigators believe the addition of Exparel to the donor site will help with improved multi-modal pain control, making patients more comfortable. It also may decrease opiate requirements which would be beneficial for burn patients.

Few previous studies have been conducted using Exparel at the donor sites of skin grafted burn patients. One case series compares usage of Exparel from two different institutions, however the sample size at each was relatively small (n=20, 5, respectively). Their findings suggest that Exparel may be an effective way of managing postsurgical donor site pain. Based on these limited data there is a need for more robust studies, which is the motivation for doing this larger evaluation of patients.

The investigators believe that the use of Exparel can decrease pain for patients after surgery, in particular at their skin graft donor sites. The investigators want to conduct this study to evaluate whether Exparel can improve pain control for their patients and decrease their need for opiate narcotics.","['Burns', 'Postoperative Pain']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

At present, there is no specific drug/therapy available for COVID-19. NK cells are the major cells of the natural immune system, which are essential for innate immunity and adaptive immunity, and are indispensable in the defense of virus infection. NKG2D is an activating receptor of NK cells, which can recognize and thus clear virus infected cells. NK cells modified by CAR play a role in targeted cell therapy, and have benn demonstrated very safe without severe side effects such as cytokine releasing syndromes. The survival time of NK cells will be very short if there is no IL-15-sustained support after adoptive transfer into the body. In comparison with natural IL-15 in vivo, IL-15 superagonist (sIL-15/IL-15Rɑ chimeric protein) has increased the activity by nearly 20 times and as well as improved pharmacokinetic characteristics with longer persistence and enhanced target cytotoxicity. CAR-T cell-mediated cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity have been shown to be abrogated through GM-CSF neutralization. ACE2 is the receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and binds to S protein of the virus envelope. We have constructed and prepared the universal off-the-shelf IL15 superagonist- and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv-secreting NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK derived from cord blood. By targeting the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and NKG2DL on the surface of infected cells with ACE2 and NKG2D, respectively, and with the strong synergistic effect of IL15 superagonist and CRS prevention through GM-CSF neutralizing scFv, we hope that the SARS-CoV-2 virus particles and their infected cells can be safely and effectively removed, thus providing a safe and effective cell therapy for COVID-19. In addition, ACE2 CAR-NK cells can competitively inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells and other important organ or tissue cells through ACE2 so as to make SARS-CoV-2 abortive infection (i.e., no production of infectious virus particles).

This project is an open, randomized, parallel, multicenter phase I/II clinical trial. The NKG2D-ACE2 CAR-NK cells secreting super IL15 superagonist and GM-CSF neutralizing scFv are going to be give by intravenous infusion (108 cells per kilogram of body weight, once a week) for the treatment of 30 patients with each common, severe and critical type COVID-19, respectively.",,['COVID-19'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

86570,NCT02000960,2016-10,ESTIMATED,"Glucose transporter deficiency syndrome (Glut1-DS) is a form of pediatric epilepsy caused by a genetic mutation that disrupts the body's ability to process food from the child's diet into sugar (energy) needed to support brain function. Children with Glut1-DS experience seizures that are not controlled by anticonvulsant medications, as well as delays in cognitive and motor development. Currently, Glut1-DS is treated with the ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-sugar diet that provides the brain with an alternate source of energy. Despite the significant improvement of seizures upon this diet, seizure control is incomplete in a majority of children, and they continue to experience problems with brain development. Our team of researchers and clinicians with expertise in metabolic diseases, neurology, pediatrics, biochemistry, and genetics believes that there is an opportunity to achieve CURE's goal of ""No Seizures/No Side Effects"" for children with Glut1-DS by investigating the use of a new treatment option that is designed to compensate for the underlying biochemical deficiency thought to contribute both to the seizures and to the impaired brain development associated with Glut1-DS. The proposed treatment involves incorporating a special type of oil, called triheptanoin, into the ketogenic diet as a way to make up for a specific biochemical deficit affecting kids with Glut1-DS that the standard ketogenic diet fails to address. Our goal is to do a pilot study to test the safety and effectiveness of this promising new treatment option in a small group of children with Glut1-DS.","BACKGROUND: Glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome (Glut1-DS) is a metabolic epileptic encephalopathy caused by defects in the cerebral glucose transporter GLUT1. It is characterized by infantile seizures refractory to anticonvulsants, deceleration of head growth, and delays in mental and motor development. Low brain glucose and subsequent energy deficiency is considered the major pathogenic factor causing seizures. The ketogenic diet (KD) is the only causal treatment available for Glut1-DS, and its therapeutic effect resides in its ability to provide an alternate source of energy for the brain. However, seizure control with KD is not complete in many patients and the long-term cognitive outcome is not optimal. Biochemically, these observations can be explained by a lack of energy for metabolic functions provided by pathways derived exclusively from glucose, which the alternate energy from the KD fails to supplement.

HYPOTHESIS: We hypothesize that an anaplerotic agent adjunct to KD may be effective for controlling seizures and improving cognitive outcomes in children with Glut1-DS. Triheptanoin (C7) is a triglyceride containing the odd chain C7 (heptanoic) fatty acid, which occurs only in limited amounts in the natural diet. It improves the oxidation of acetyl CoA by the tricarbonic acid (TCA) cycle, leading to subsequent oxidative phosporylation by the electron transport chain to produce sufficient ATP for energy utilization. It also provides the TCA intermediates alpha ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate, which are important precursors for the neurotransmitters glutamate, GABA, and aspartate. Therefore, we expect these metabolic effects will enhance seizure control and/or neurodevelopmental function.

SPECIFIC AIMS: We aim to generate preliminary evidence on 1) the safety, 2) the clinical, and 3) the biochemical effects of C7 as an add on therapy in GLUT1-DS patients with inadequate response to ketogenic diet.

RESEARCH PLAN: To generate preliminary data and a better understanding of the precise biochemical mechanism of this novel treatment, we will conduct a pilot/proof of concept study using an open-label n-of-1 trial with 'an interrupted time-series before and after' design. We plan to enrol 3 Glut1-DS patients with incomplete seizure control, and the n-of-1 study design will help provide a distinct effectiveness estimate of C7 in each individual patient. As each participant acts as his/her own control, this design also supports an evidence-based, personalized medicine approach to treatment.

SIGNIFICANCE: If successful, this personalized treatment approach may be extended to GLUT1-DS patients with other symptoms refractory to the KD, or those who cannot tolerate the diet, and ultimately will serve as a model for eliminating seizures and side effects in other medically refractory epilepsies. The data generated with this study will be essential to design future trials for a larger number of Glut1-DS patients to create high-grade evidence.",['Glucose Transporter Type 1 Deficiency Syndrome'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Researchers will study whether this combination can help to control the disease, and look at the safety of this combination. Researchers also want to find out if combining busulfan with clofarabine alone or combining busulfan with both fludarabine and clofarabine will improve the treatment, compared with the previous standard method using busulfan and fludarabine alone.","Busulfan is a chemotherapy drug that kills cancer cells by binding to DNA (the genetic material of cells). Clofarabine is designed to interfere with the growth and development of cancer cells. Fludarabine is designed to interfere with DNA repair enzymes so that the leukemic cells cannot repair damaged DNA. This may increase the likelihood of the cell dying. These drugs are being given to try to kill cancerous cells and weaken your immune system in order to lower the risk of stem cell transplant rejection.

If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as in the toss of a coin) to 1 of 4 study groups. Three (3) of the groups will receive busulfan, fludarabine, and clofarabine at different dose levels. The 4th group will only receive busulfan and clofarabine. As the study continues, participants will be assigned using a method called adaptive randomization. This method works by increasing the chances of being assigned to the group that has had the best results in the study so far. You will know which group you have been assigned to.

Participants will receive busulfan, fludarabine, and/or clofarabine once a day for 4 doses. You will first receive an additional low-level ""test"" dose of busulfan given by vein to check how your blood levels change over time. This information will be used to decide the next dose needed to reach a target blood level of busulfan. You will have a total of about 6 and 1/2 tablespoons of blood drawn over time to check your busulfan blood levels following one or more of the busulfan treatments. Up to 11 samples of blood will be drawn to check your blood levels of busulfan during the next 11 hours following the test dose and the first high-dose busulfan treatment. Each sample will require about 1 teaspoon of blood. A heparin lock line will be placed in a vein to lower the number of needle sticks needed for these draws. If it is not possible for these blood level tests to be performed for technical or scheduling reasons, you will receive the standard fixed (unchanging) dose of busulfan.

Clofarabine and fludarabine (if applicable) will be given through a central venous catheter (CVC) over 1 hour, once a day, for 4 days. Busulfan will also be given through the CVC over 3 hours.

If you are going to be receiving a transplant from an HLA-nonidentical or unrelated donor, you will also receive thymoglobulin (ATG) over 4 hours on the 3 days before the transplant to further weaken your immune system to reduce the risk of rejecting of the transplant. After the transplant, you will receive tacrolimus, methotrexate, or other immunosuppressive (lowering the immune system) drugs in the standard manner to lower the risk of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), a reaction of the donor's immune cells against the recipient's body.

The allogeneic stem cells (bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells) will also be given through the CVC. You will receive the drug G-CSF (filgrastim) as an injection under the skin once a day, starting 1 week after the transplant, until your blood cell levels return to normal.

Patients usually stay in the hospital for about 4 weeks after stem cell transplantation. After you are released from the hospital, you will continue to be monitored as an outpatient for infections and transplant-related complications for at least 100 days after the transplant.

You will have blood tests (about 4 tablespoons of blood) and bone marrow aspirations performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the transplant, to check if the disease is in remission (has not come back). Your health status will be followed with the help of your local doctor to find out if the leukemia or MDS comes back, as well as to check the length of your survival.

This is an investigational study. All of the drugs used in this study are approved by the FDA for treatment of cancer. Busulfan has been approved for use in stem cell transplantation. The use of these drugs together with stem cell transplant is experimental. Up to 70 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at the M. D.

The ideal sedative agent - with a short duration of action, predictable wake-up times, low drug toxicity, haemodynamic stability and less side effects, and a rational pharmacoeconomic impact nowadays - has still to be found. Inhalative anaesthetics show these properties, but until the introduction of AnaConDa© (Anesthetic Conserving Device, ACD) in 2005, the use of volatile anaesthetics on the intensive care unit (ICU) required specific evaporating devices or scavenging systems. The ACD, a modified heat- moisture filter, is connected to the breathing circuit of conventional ICU ventilators and a syringe pump delivers the volatile anaesthetic to the ACD where it is vaporized through a rod. Most of the exhaled gas is absorbed in a charcoal filter's membrane and reflected to the patient in the following inspiration. Randomised, controlled and comparative studies to the use of volatile anaesthetics in ICU via this innovative device are still missing.

Are there any long term sequelae of INK at one week?","Whistler/Blackcomb is a large world-class resort that attracts hundreds of thousands of skiers and snowboarders annually for it's steep terrain and excellent on-mountain facilities. Ski patrol operations exist on both mountains and respond to over 10000 injuries per year (1). As both skiing and snowboarding activities gain popularity, the number of people injured also rises (2) as does the demand on ski patrol and attending on-mountain physicians to provide adequate on-mountain treatment.

The provision of analgesia, both to relieve patient suffering and facilitate transport, is a central tenet of pre-hospital care. This is of special import in an alpine setting where environmental factors and challenges with extrication play a significant role in patient outcomes (3). Despite its significance to both patient and practitioner, adequate and timely pain relief is often delayed. The underlying cause is multifactorial; intravenous access is challenging, there is limited availability of advanced health care providers and monitoring capabilities. To date, there remain no widespread guidelines for treatment of acute pain in alpine rescue and ski patrol setting.

Intravenous (IV) opioid analgesia is widely used as a primary method of attaining pain control. While effective, this route of administration has several shortcomings. The insertion of an IV is invasive, painful,, time-consuming, exposes skin to cold injury and delays transport. Opioids also raise the risk of hypotension, hypoxemia and vomiting. In previous work (15), the intranasal (IN) route of medication delivery is rapid, effective and well-tolerated. In addition adverse side effects are minor and transient, and there are no changes in vital signs that required clinical intervention.

This data corroborated previous research that low dose ketamine provides safe and meaningful analgesia while preserving cardiovascular function, respiratory drive and airway reflexes (27). Thus, the use of IN ketamine reduces the need for IV access in stable patients and and reduces the need for monitoring to the risks of opioids (6). These characteristics indicate great potential for ketamine in reducing the extraction and transport time of patients from the mountain environment.

Intranasal ketamine is very attractive in austere and alpine environments, where monitoring capabilities slow transport and IV access is difficult. Previous case reports suggest that IN ketamine provides a rapid, easily administered and effective method of analgesia in the pre-hospital setting (7). However, there is no data on the feasibility of conducting a medical trial in a large busy commercial ski area, nor to calculate an appropriate sample size. The investigators propose a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of conducting a study of IN ketamine (INK) prior to a larger study to determine if INK provides an effective and safe method of analgesia for patients presenting to ski patrol with acute injuries. In addition, although the current body of literature shows minimal adverse events, the investigators will continue to study the safety of INK and monitor for any negative side effects. The purpose is to provide insight and information on the potential utility of IN ketamine in this setting, and to assess feasibility of future clinical trials powered to demonstrate efficacy and safety.","['Pain', 'Traumatic Limb Injury']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Participants will be randomized into three groups. The three experimental groups received either bilateral or ipsilateral rTMS, or iTBS (with contralateral sham stimulation) at suprahyoid motor cortex, while the placebo group received bilateral sham stimulation. Stimulation will be given at 5 hertz(Hz), 1000 pulses of rTMS or 600 pulses of iTBS per session, for a total of 10 sessions. The swallowing function, penetration-aspiration scale of video-fluoroscopic swallowing study, motor evoked potential of suprahyoid muscles, intraoral pressure, and ultrasound swallowing exam will be evaluated before therapy, and at 1, 3, 6 months post therapy.","Swallowing dysfunction, or dysphagia, is a common complication following stroke. Although spontaneous recovery of swallowing function was seen in most patients in a time course of a few weeks to 6 months after stroke, around 50% of patients recovered slowly and had chronic dysphagia clinically. It is worth noting that dysphagia has great impact on clinical outcome, in terms of not only quality of life but also risk of severe complication such as aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition, and even death.

After damage on swallowing ability, several cause would arise risk of aspiration and one of them was inadequate hyolaryngeal elevation. Suprahyoid muscle played an important role in hyolaryngeal movement so re-training on suprahyoid muscle might be an efficient method.

Conventional treatments of dysphagia focused on restore or improve swallowing functions through oropharyngeal muscle training, swallowing maneuvers, or compensation strategy. However, the effectiveness of traditional therapy was still limited and inconsistent.

Noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS) has gained increasing attention as a promising neuromodulation therapy which could improve neurological deficit and functional level through inducing the cortical neuroplasticity. Among NIBS, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is the most widely used and delved. It has been utilized in stroke patient for promoting functional reorganization and modulate neural connection in motor and language area. In a previous network meta-analysis, we also indicated that rTMS showed the best efficacy in improving the swallowing function in acute and subacute poststroke dysphagia, when compared with transcranial direct current stimulation, surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and pharyngeal electrical stimulation (PES). Despite of the positive results, there was still limited evidence on the effect of rTMS in chronic dysphagia and the mechanism by which rTMS improved dysphagia outcome is unclear. Specifically, whether the rTMS on a representation cortex directly increase functional gain, such as strength and contractility of the target area remained unclear. On the other hand, theta burst stimulation (TBS), consisting of continuous TBS (cTBS) and intermittent TBS (iTBS), is a new stimulation model of TMS and seemed to be helpful on motor recovery in chronic stroke. Furthermore, previous research had showed iTBS was not inferior to rTMS on the improvement of poststroke dysphagia using stimulation at suprahyoid motor cortex of affected hemisphere. In this study, we aim to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of both high frequency rTMS and iTBS applying on suprahyoid motor cortex in chronic poststroke dysphagia, and its effect on hyolaryngeal movement.

In each stage, patients with subcortical stroke will be randomized into three groups. The three experimental groups receive either bilateral or ipsilateral rTMS, or iTBS (with contralateral sham stimulation) at suprahyoid motor cortex, while the placebo group receive bilateral sham stimulation.

All participants will be interviewed about their childhood, jobs, habits, medical conditions, and treatments. They also will provide a blood sample and a saliva sample, obtained by swishing a mouthwash for 45 seconds and spitting it into a container.

Blood will be tested for two viruses KSHV and HIV that are related to Kapsosi s sarcoma. The KSHV virus is newly discovered and not well understood. In general, a positive KSHV test probably means an infection with the virus has occurred in the past, but not necessarily that disease has developed. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS. People with AIDS have a high risk of Kapsosi s sarcoma. Although HIV and AIDS are very rare among older adults in Sicily, the presence of HIV must be ruled out in order to understand how KSHV is related to Kapsosi s sarcoma.

The proposed study will test specific hypotheses and generate new hypotheses on the risk of cKS among persons who have antibodies against KSHV, on the risk of KSHV seropositivity, and on the risk of active KSHV infection, defined as KSHV viremia or viral shedding in saliva. To do so, 120 incident cases of cKS from throughout Sicily and approximately 1800 persons (15% KSHV seropositive) of similar age, sex, and community size will be asked to participate by providing questionnaire data and blood and saliva specimens. Residual formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded tissue from KS skin biopsies will be available for verification of diagnosis and molecular analyses. Primary hypotheses are focused on host genetic susceptibility, endogenous clinical conditions (such as asthma and allergy), and exogenous exposures (cigarette smoking and contact with certain plants, water and soil) that are postulated to affect KSHV activation, dissemination, and disease induction. The study will have sufficient statistical power to detect factors that increase the risk of KSHV seropositivity by 1.5- to 2-fold, the risk of cKS by 2- to 3-fold, and the risk of KSHV viremia or shedding by 3- to 4-fold.","[""Kaposi's Sarcoma""]",OBSERVATIONAL,"* INCLUSION CRITERIA - CASES:

Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving vaccine therapy and chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with paclitaxel and carboplatin works in treating patients who are undergoing surgery for stage III or stage IV ovarian cancer, primary peritoneal cancer, or fallopian tube cancer.","OBJECTIVES:

* Determine the immunogenicity of vaccine therapy comprising synthetic ovarian cancer-associated peptides administered with a synthetic tetanus toxoid helper peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 before or after paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with stage III-IV ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer undergoing optimal cytoreductive surgery.

OUTLINE: This is an open-label study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

* Group 1:

  * Neoadjuvant chemotherapy:Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then proceed to surgical debulking.
  * Surgical debulking: Patients undergo primary optimal cytoreductive surgery.
  * Vaccine therapy: Within 14 days after surgery, patients receive vaccine therapy comprising synthetic ovarian cancer-associated peptides, MAGE-A1:161-169, FBP:1901-199, Her-2/neu:369-377, MAGE-A1:96-104, and Her-2/neu:754-762, and tetanus toxoid helper peptide emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 intradermally and subcutaneously on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 14 weeks for 2 courses.
  * Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive 4 courses of paclitaxel and carboplatin as in neoadjuvant chemotherapy after completion of course 1 of vaccine therapy.
* Group 2:

  * Surgical debulking: Patients undergo up-front optimal cytoreductive surgery. Patients with non-optimal primary debulking may undergo interval debulking surgery within 6 weeks after completing course 4 of adjuvant chemotherapy. If interval debulking surgery is performed, tumor and/or lymph node tissue is collected.
  * Vaccine therapy: Patients receive 2 courses of vaccine therapy as in group 1.
  * Adjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in group 1, neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses.

Patients undergo periodic blood and tumor tissue collection during study for correlative immunological analysis.

After completion of study treatment, patients with progressive disease are followed at 30 days and then every six months thereafter. All other patients are followed every 3 months for 36 months until disease progression or until another therapy is initiated, and then every six months thereafter.

364991,NCT02133326,2017-01,ESTIMATED,"This study will compare how effective a single dose of an intravenous (IV) ibuprofen is when compared to single dose of IV acetaminophen in reducing pain. We will administer this study medication thirty minutes prior to removal of wisdom teeth. We want to see if administering these drugs prior to surgery may reduce post-operative pain.

Administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug before the onset of inflammation during surgery will reduce postoperative pain following third molar extraction when compared to the acetaminophen group. Subjects receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug will consume less opioid medications compared to those receiving preemptive acetaminophen.","The surgical removal of third molars is a common surgical procedure performed in dentistry. Surgery to extract an impacted third molar can be due to various reasons such as infection, caries, pain, cyst or tumor formation, or to facilitate orthodontic treatment. Both clinicians and patients are concerned with the postoperative pain following surgery.

Rationale for model selection The oral surgery model is well-suited for the measurement of acute pain.The model has been shown to be sensitive to the effects of analgesic drugs and is useful for examining peripheral biochemical measures of drugs in vivo.This model is recommended by the US Food and Drug Administration because patients are usually healthy without complicating medical conditions and most patients have pain for a short, predictable period after surgery.

Rationale for drug selection Pain from the surgical incision and tissue manipulation associated with the surgical procedure is instigated immediately. This gives way to inflammatory pain that follows inflammatory cell recruitment to the injured area within the course of several hours. Inflammatory pain generally continues for several days, depending on the nature of the surgical procedure. As a consequence of tissue damage and release of neurogenic inflammatory mediators, there is activation of specific receptors and pathways that can contribute to central sensitization and development of hyperalgesia and persistent pain. While various pharmacological strategies, including the use of opioids, provide adequate attenuation of pain, their use is associated with undesirable side effects, drug interactions, pharmacokinetic variability, and often inadequate dosing, all of which can lead to ineffective analgesia and prolonged suffering. Opioids do not interrupt the inflammatory component of pain.

The study drug Caldolor® is an intravenous formulation of ibuprofen which was approved by the FDA in June 2009. Caldolor® is the first injectable product available in the United States for the treatment of pain and fever. This is the first study in dentistry evaluating the use of Caldolor® as a preemptive analgesia. Southworth et al and colleagues randomized 406 patients undergoing elective single-site orthopedic or abdominal surgery to 400 mg intravenous (IV) Caldolor, 800 mg IV Caldolor, or placebo. The results showed that patients in the 800 mg group had a 25.6% lower median morphine use (P = .026) over the first 24 hours of treatment than the placebo group. Patients in the 400 mg group did not have a lower use of morphine, but both the 400 and 800 mg groups reported less pain at rest and with movement than with placebo.

The comparator group Ofirmev® is intravenous acetaminophen and was recently approved by the FDA for the management of mild to moderate pain, the management of moderate to severe pain with adjunctive opioid analgesics, and the reduction of fever. In a study conducted for total abdominal hysterectomy, preemptive IV paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1 g provided good quality postoperative analgesia, with decreased consumption of morphine and minimal side effects. Studies have showed that the use of 1 g of paracetamol as a single intravenous preemptive dose in abdominal surgery with perioperative epidural analgesia did not reduce the analgesic consumption and the intensity of pain in the postoperative period.

Use of Pain Scale VAS Pain Scale Score: The primary end point is the clinical report of pain. Pain intensity will be assessed using a 100 mm VAS with anchors of ""no pain"" and ""worst pain imaginable"" and a 4-point category scale (""none"", ""mild"", ""moderate"", and ""severe"") once pre-operatively and over the post-operative observation period at 30-minute intervals during the post- surgical time. The category scale is included for purposes of obtaining a patient-reported assignment of moderate pain (definition of clinically significant pain), and for computing the cut-offs for pain sensitivity.",['Impacted Wisdom Teeth'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

261437,NCT05809921,2023-09-13,ACTUAL,"The purpose of this study (Dual IV thrombolysis Approach (DIVA) study) is to assess a new medical strategy for Medium-vessel-occlusion (MeVO) strokes, based on a second IV thrombolysis with tenecteplase (TNK) for persistent intracranial occlusion on MRI 1-2 hours after standard alteplase infusion. The DIVA-study results were compared with a similar cohort of MeVO strokes patients treated with standard therapy (single IVT with alteplase) during the same timeframe in another stroke unit.","MeVO strokes account for 25-40% of all acute ischemic stroke (AIS). In a recent study, less than 1/3 of MeVO strokes patients had a so-called ""minor stroke"" (National Institute of Health Stroke score (NIHSS)\<6), thereby emphasizing that strategically located MeVO strokes can be debilitating. Therefore it is crucial to achieve early recanalization, which is strongly associated with excellent outcomes. However, standard medical treatment (that is to say, a single intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) with alteplase 0.9mg/kg) resulted in early (60-120 min) and late (24-36 hours) recanalizations of MeVO in only 30% and 64% respectively. As a consequence, and in line with a recent study, almost 40% of these patients were functionally dependent at 3 months (modified Rankin Score\>2) despite IVT.

Because randomized clinical trials on EVT enrolled only limited numbers of patients with distal occlusions, mostly proximal M2 segment-middle cerebral artery occlusions, EVT has not yet been established as standard-of-care for MeVO strokes, and owing to the fragility of these small intracranial arteries, safety of EVT for MeVO is questionable and randomized trials are ongoing.

In comparison with EVT, a purely chemical strategy for MeVO strokes would be far less human-resource demanding, cheaper and feasible almost everywhere. In a previous study, the investigators showed results in favor of a high rate of recanalization at 24h in patients with stroke due to proximal occlusion with a dual IVT strategy (additional IVT with TNK in patients with persistent occlusion 1h after alteplase IVT), and this with a low hemorrhagic risk. Distal arterial occlusions are at lower hemorrhagic risk than proximal occlusions because volume infarcts are smaller, and because they spare basal ganglia, a critical location for massive hemorrhagic transformation of AIS. Moreover, patients could be carefully pre-selected with the initial MRI evaluation, allowing exclusion of patients with severe microangiopathy or amyloid angiopathy.

From March 1, 2014, to November 31, 2018, the investigators proposed a dual-IVT strategy (DIS) to patients admitted to the CHSF-Stroke Unit for MeVO-associated AIS eligible for IVT but not suitable for EVT. They were given a repeat MRI 1-2h after alteplase, 0.9 mg/kg, maximum 90 mg (IVT-1). If no recanalization was obtained and in the absence of exclusion criteria (acute lesion visible on FLAIR sequence, new cerebral/subarachnoid hemorrhage; significant extracerebral bleeding), a second IVT with TNK, 0.25 mg/kg, maximum 25 mg) (IVT-2) was given. The whole procedure was done within 6h of symptom onset.

During the same period, Bordeaux University Hospital-Stroke Unit constituted a cohort of consecutive patients with MeVO-AIS treated with conventional single-IVT strategy (SIS) using alteplase.

DIS- and SIS-cohort data were collected prospectively and the comparison was retrospective.

The pre-specified primary efficacy endpoint was successful recanalization assessed on MRI at 24h. The pre-specified primary safety endpoint was severe bleeding: symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or major systemic bleeding during the first 36 hours. Secondary endpoints were: early neurological improvement at 24h, early complete neurological recovery at 24h and excellent (modified Rankin scale (mRS) 0-1) and good (mRS 0-2) clinical outcomes at 3 months.",['Acute Ischemic Stroke Due to Medium-vessel-occlusion'],OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

This clinical trial was intended to confirm in humans the potential efficacy identified in animals. The primary objective was to compare against a placebo the effect of Ulva L.L extract in healthy volunteers whose anhedonia was characterized by a component of depression.,"The trial comprised three visits: a medical enrollment visit on D0, an intermediate visit on D28 and a final visit on D84. A psychologist made a telephone call after 7 days to check there was no sudden change in the subject's depressive state. During the visits, the subject was examined by a doctor and the psychometric tests were administered by a psychologist. Outside the visits, the subject was monitored by a self-reporting questionnaire in the manner described below.

After obtaining informed written consent and validating the inclusion and exclusion criteria, notably the absence of MDE as per DSM V, the investigator enrolled the subject in the trial. The physician described the subject's demographic and general clinical characteristics, the main medical and surgical history and any current treatment if those pathologies were still present, and any previous antidepressant, anxiolytic or neuroleptic treatments. The doctor asked the subject to complete the SHAPS and QIDS -SR questionnaires and item 7 of the HAM-D. The doctor then handed the subject self-evaluation questionnaires explaining how to complete them and the dates at which they were to be completed. The physician gave the patient a batch of the placebo or a batch of Ulva lactuca as per the randomization. The doctor told the subject a psychologist would be in touch after one week by telephone to check no DSM V severity criterion had arisen.

The investigating doctor saw the subject again at the four-week intermediate visit and at the final visit at the end of the 12th week of follow-up. The doctor collected the self-questionnaires at these visits and the same items as at the enrollment visit were recorded by the physician for describing how the items had evolved and notably the SHAP scale score, the QIDS-SR and item 7 of the HAM-D.

247184,NCT06156254,2026-06-01,ESTIMATED,The purpose of this study is to find out if a community health workers (CHW) intervention conducted in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) can increase the number of adults with chronic illnesses who are up-to-date with their COVID-19 and influenza vaccines.,"Many factors contribute to inequities in vaccination rates among racial and ethnic minorities, including differences in vaccine acceptance and intention and related variability in social behavioral norms, knowledge, risk perception, trust, and structural barriers. The World Health Organization has called for community health workers (CHWs) as a key strategy to address vaccination inequities among vulnerable populations worldwide. CHWs are trusted messengers and cultural brokers that can address barriers to vaccination access and provide language, culturally, and literacy-appropriate information to promote awareness of and motivation to partake in protective vaccination behaviors. CHWs can have a central role in Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) by helping link their mostly non-White patients with health care and community resources.

This study examines whether a CHW intervention can be effective in increasing vaccination rates by providing education, help with behavior changes, and assistance in navigating barriers to increase equal access to vaccination. The CHW intervention consists of up to 3 psychoeducational sessions in English or Spanish targeting the specific reason(s) why a patient is not up to date with their COVID-19 vaccine. According to the reason(s), the CHW implements strategies to educate, motivate, and help navigate any access barriers to getting vaccinated. CHWs use motivational interviewing techniques to encourage patients to get vaccinated. Patients also receive educational flyers designed by a local artist addressing their own COVID-19 vaccination knowledge gaps. Toward the end of each session, the CHW works with the patient to create a Patient Action Plan with steps the patient can take to overcome their barriers to vaccination.

RAND and Clinical Directors Network (CDN) are conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in New York City FHQCs to determine the efficacy of the CHW intervention to improve vaccine acceptance and uptake among racial/ethnic minority adults with any of 7 chronic conditions (asthma, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, depression, anxiety disorder, or PTSD). This research study plans to randomly assign (like the flip of a coin) a total of 800 patients to a ""Usual Care Group"" (400 patients who will continue to receive usual care with no changes) or ""CHW Group"" (400 patients who will receive the CHW intervention and usual care).

The following four research questions guide the study:

* What makes being up to date for COVID and Flu vaccines difficult for people with chronic illness?
* Can a CHW intervention help patients be up to date with the COVID and Flu vaccines?
* What about the CHW intervention specifically works for different types of patients?
* What can help expand the CHW program to more people for a longer time?

The main study hypothesis is that participants assigned to the intervention will exhibit significantly higher vaccine acceptance and actual increases in vaccination rates.

If the intervention is effective, it has the potential to decrease disparities in severe illness resulting from COVID-19 and influenza by increasing vaccination rates among racial and ethnic minority populations with chronic illness. Since FQHCs employ CHWs to help deliver care to patients with chronic illnesses, the intervention would be easily implementable and scalable for future COVID-19 and influenza vaccination seasons.",['COVID-19 Vaccination'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:18 years or older AND speak English or Spanish AND have no obvious physical or cognitive impairment that would make them unable to complete the assessment (as indicated by confusion or inability to understand the questions).

Methods: For the Primary Study, a web-based platform will be built for this project and an educational campaign will be developed in dating apps to encourage HCV testing. The web platform will contain modules with information on HCV infection and a log-in to request HCV self-tests that can be delivered by the post or collected in the centralized pharmacy for HCV testing. People will be encouraged to report their HCVST results in the online platform. People with positive HCV antibody will be linked-to-care for HCV infection confirmation and treatment initiation.

Participants will read written instructions and watch a video explaining the procedures step-by-step for HCVST. A second HCV test using the same kit will be performed by the healthcare worker for concordance analysis. People with positive HCV antibodies will be linked to HCV infection confirmation and treatment initiation.

Data analysis: Descriptive statistical analysis will be used to evaluate the characteristics of people seeking HCVST, participant's preferences, uptake of HCV testing using self-test kits and internet technologies, as well as acceptability, usability and result interpretation of HCVST in a sub-sample of participants.

Despite the availability of rapid tests as well as universal access to safe and highly effective drugs for HCV treatment for free of charge, the HCV HCV continuum of care remains unsatisfactory. HCV transmission due to sexual activities are increasing in Brazil, especially among young men. It is well known that MSM and/or TGW are at high risk for HCV infection. HCV infection in these key populations might occur mainly in the context of traumatic sex practices that increase the risk of blood-blood contact. The use of drug prior to or during sex (chem-sex) might be associated with HCV infection. Few studies have reported the prevalence of HCV infection among SGM in Brazil. Firstly, a single center study that included a limited sample (n=522) using Respondent-Driven Sampling reported a prevalence of anti-HCV positive of 1.3% (95%CI: 0.3-5.5) in MSM in Central region. All people with anti-HCV positive reported high-risk sexual behaviors, condomless use at anal intercourse and frequent chem-sex \[39\]. More recently, the prospective, single-arm, open-label, multicentre PrEP implementation study conducted in Brazil (14 sites), Mexico (4 sites), and Peru (10 sites) included 9,509 HIV-negative MSM and TGW for daily oral initiation of PrEP. Prevalence of hepatitis C increased from the enrolment to week-52 among participants from Mexico and Peru, cisgender men, and those aged 25-30 years. In Brazil (n=3,928), the prevalence of HCV infection was 0.34% (95%CI 0.16-0.52) and 0.58% (95%CI 0.24-0.91) at enrolment and week-52, respectively \[40\]. Similarly, a Brazilian study reported an HCV prevalence of 0.66% (anti-HCV positive in 340 from 51,486 tests) in key populations (MSM, transgender people, people who inject drugs, and sex workers) in Curitiba (Southern region) \[24\] Similar to other countries, HIV coinfection and injection drug use have been associated with increased risk of HCV infection/reinfection in Brazil. Prevalence of HCV infection (2.7%) was mostly associated with injection drug use in the last year \[OR=10.33 (95%CI 4.74-22.52)\] and HIV infection \[OR=4.74 (95%CI 1.82-12.36)\] in Brazilian men prisoners (n=2,848)\[41\].

Large scale screening for hepatitis C in high-risk people and linkage-to-care are cornerstones towards to HCV elimination. HCVST can decrease the barriers to traditional testing by increasing convenience and privacy. Lesson learned with HIVST can be informative and suggest that this new/additional testing approach may help to increase HCV testing and linkage to care and treatment. A recently released guideline by the WHO recommended HCVST to scale-up HCV screening \[6\]. In brief, this guideline recommends that HCVST should be offered as an additional approach to facility-based HCV testing. Additionally, HCVST needs to be followed by confirmation of viremic infection (HCV-RNA), and linkage-to-treatment, and HCVST service delivery should be adapted to local context, which includes community preferences. However, the usability of HCVST kits, cost-effective, non-discriminatory and inclusive service delivery and optimal position of HCVST in national HCV programs must be addressed. Stigma is an important element in the experience of living with chronic HCV infection, especially in SGM persons. This stigma impacts in healthcare access and uptake as well as health outcomes. The use of HCVST can help to mitigate the stigma along the HCV continuum of care. Additionally, the immediate linkage to care after a positive HCVST using telehealth might reduce mental distress from positive results.

Recent studies have evaluated the usability, acceptability, and rates of interpretation of results from different kits (blood-based and oral fluid) of HCVST worldwide. Few studies reported high acceptability and usability of oral-fluid HCVST in key populations (mostly MSM), especially in the USA, European countries and Asia. However, data on delivery-services of HCVST kits and uptake of HCV testing using HCVST remain scarce in Latin American countries. Additionally, data on the usability of HCVST in MSM/TGW, especially blood-based tests, still lacking in Brazil. This study will evaluate the uptake of HCV testing by the strategy of using HCVST that would be able to be ordered by the internet and delivery by the post in key populations (SGM) living in the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Additionally, a sub-study will assess the acceptability, usability and result interpretation of different kits of HCVST in MSM/TGW using PrEP in a reference center in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).

This project will assess operational research priorities about HCVST in Brazil. The investigators expect to fulfill gaps of knowledge on product optimization (acceptability and usability of blood-based and oral fluid HCVST kits), service delivery and linkage pathways to confirmatory testing and treatment after reactive HCVST results in one of the largest agglomerations worldwide, such as the metropolitan area of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). The investigators expect to increase HCV testing by using an online platform to inform about HCV infection where people will be able to order HCVST that can be delivered by the post. Additionally, our strategy will include an offer of HIVST with HCVST (combo HIV/HCVST) to increase interest for HCV testing and a massive advertising campaign in dating-apps used by SGM (e.g. Grindr, Scruff and Hornet). In addition, the investigators expect that HCVST will be highly accepted and easy to be performed among PrEP users in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil).

This protocol will be composed by a Primary Study and an Ancillary Study that will be conducted in parallel.

OBJECTIVES:

The Primary Study will assess HCVST using internet-technologies among SGM. The main hypothesis of the Primary Study is that HCVST ordered in an online platform and delivered by the post will increase HCV testing uptake among SGM.

The Ancillary Study will assess the acceptability and usability of different kits of HCVST in MSM/TGW under PrEP. The main hypothesis of the Ancillary Study is that blood-based and oral fluid HCVST will be well accepted and easily to be performed among MSM/TGW under PrEP in a referral center in Rio de Janeiro (Brazil)

Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is defined as common anterior knee pain that occurs during non-traumatic activities such as squatting, running, climbing and climbing stairs.The effectiveness of electrotherapy in increasing muscle strength and endurance in PFPS has generally been investigated using low frequency electrical stimulation methods, and studies on the effectiveness of medium frequency burst module alternating currents are few in number. Since there are no studies in the literature comparing the efficacy of Russian and Aussie currents from mid-frequency burst modulated alternating currents with isokinetic exercise in patients with PFPS, the aim of this study is to examine the pain, functionality, daily living activities of Russian and Aussie currents with knee and hip Isokinetic Exercise (IE) in patients with PFPS and its effect on quality of life.

This study, which has a randomized controlled and single-blind design, is planned to be conducted on at least 60 volunteers who meet the inclusion criteria of patients with PFPS who came to Necmettin Erbakan University Sports Medicine Clinic. Participants' physical and socio-demographic information will be recorded; pain intensity Patellofemoral Syndrome Pain Severity Scale; functionality Kujala Patellofemoral Score, Timed Up and Go Test and stair climb test; activity levels Tegner Activity Level score; functional impairment Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale; activities of daily living Knee Test for Activities of Daily Living; quality of life Short Form SF-36; passive and painless active range of motion goniometer; Isokinetic forces of quadriceps, hamstring and gluteus medius muscles CYBEX (2009) device; The Q angle will be evaluated using a goniometer.

Participants will be randomized into four groups; The first group will receive knee and hip IE treatment for three weeks for 15 sessions, the second group will receive Aussie Current in addition to IE, the third group will receive Russian Current in addition to IE, and the fourth group will receive placebo electrical stimulation in addition to IE. Evaluations will be made at the beginning, immediately after the first treatment, at the end of three weeks of treatment and one month after the end of the treatment, in total four times. It is thought that the results of the study will be an important source of information about the place of medium frequency burst modulated alternating currents in physiotherapy programs of patients with PFPS.","Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) is the most common pain syndrome of the knee arising around the patella due to knee overload during flexion and extension. It is defined as common anterior knee pain that occurs during non-traumatic activities such as squatting, running, climbing and climbing stairs. Risk factors for PFPS include dynamic valgus, female gender, foot abnormalities, overuse and sudden increase in physical activity, patellar instability, and quadriceps weakness .

In order to reveal effective treatment in PFPS, primary reasons that may cause the syndrome should be emphasized. The causes of PFPS are multifactorial and it is difficult to determine the actual effects that may cause the disease.However, when PFPS is considered from a biomechanical point of view, there is a strong relationship between the knee joint and the ankle and hip joint.

While rest, ice and analgesics are used in the early period in PFPS treatment, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), patellar banding, patellofemoral knee and foot orthoses, biofeedback, running gait retraining, blood circulation restriction therapy are used in the treatment of PFPS in the early period. Dry needling, manual therapy, biophysical agents, patient education and combined therapies are used. In the treatment of patellofemoral pain syndrome, the treatment method that has been focused in recent years is conservative treatment. Among these, physiotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment.

Although the common treatment is quadriceps strengthening, in recent years, therapies have been emphasized to strengthen the gluteus medius and increase the stability of the core. At the 5th International Meeting of the Patellofemoral Pain Research Center (2018, Australia), combined strengthening programs with strengthening of the quadriceps and hip muscles were recommended in the treatment of PFPS.

Although a versatile treatment is generally performed, the rate of PFAS recurrence is 91%. Due to the high recurrence rate, more effective treatment options should be revealed. When the literature is reviewed, it has been reported that in PFPS cases, there is an increase in muscle strength and endurance with the isokinetic exercise (IE) program, and this provides dynamic knee stabilization.The IE program is mostly in the direction of knee flexion / extension, and it has been found that there are very few applications of IE programs in the direction of hip (gluteus medius) abduction / adduction, internal and external rotation.

Physiotherapy applications are directed towards the management of developing dysfunction and reducing pain. Strengthening and endurance training are emphasized in routine treatment. Although isokinetic enhancement programs are the most effective method in treatment, neuromuscular electrical stimulation rehabilitation programs are also frequently used. The effectiveness of eletrotherapy modalities to increase muscle strength and endurance is not clear. Among these, medium frequency burst modality alternative (Russian and Australian) current can be used as a new treatment option. Low frequency pulsed currents (LFPC) and medium (kHz) frequency alternating currents (FAC) are frequently used in physiotherapy and rehabilitation.

Austrian current (AC) is a more effective and comfortable current between 1-10 kHz medium frequency currents. This current can be used for various purposes including muscle strengthening, pain control, increasing circulation, edema control and aesthetic treatments.

AC started to be used in the Latin America region with the devices it launched with Ibramed company in 2010. It creates much less discomfort in the patient compared to AC Russ Current (RC) and low frequency currents. It is used in sinusoidal wave form.

In recent meta-analysis studies on PFAS, she stated that new methods should be aimed at identifying the most cost-effective and most effective treatment modalities. Although there are studies in the literature showing the effect of neuromuscular electrical stimulation, it has been found that there are no studies comparing medium frequency burst modulated alternating currents (AC and RC) with IE in patients with PFPS.

In the national literature, there are no scientific studies on the Australian current method. The application of RC and AC together with the isokinetic method, whose effectiveness has been determined in the literature, is very important in terms of determining the most effective treatment method.

Objectives of the study In individuals with PFPS, isokinetic IE together with medium frequency burst modality alternating currents;

* To reduce the pain during rest and activity,
* Increasing functional mobility,
* Facilitating Activities of Daily Living (FADL),
* To increase the quality of life.

Sample of the Research Power analysis G\*Power 3.1.9.2 program was used to calculate the sample size. The power of the research is defined as the possibility of revealing the difference between the two applications. The effect size was 0.25, the alpha level was 0.05, and the power of the study was 0.95, and it was determined that a total of 52 subjects should be included in the study in the calculation made in the form of four groups and four repeated measurements made in the G-power program. In similar studies in the literature, it was determined that there was a 15% loss. In this study, it was planned that a total of 60 cases should be included in the study, assuming 15% loss.

Application Closed opaque envelopes showing the patient's group will be prepared. Opaque envelopes will be listed from 1 to 60 according to the randomly generated numbers. An envelope will be given to the patient according to the order of the incoming patient. The assignment code of each patient will only be disclosed to the physiotherapist performing the treatment at the beginning of the treatment protocol.The physiotherapist will include the patient in the group in accordance with the code and perform the application.It will be ensured that subjects in the RC, AC and placebo electrical stimulation groups do not know what type of stimulation they were given.

Pilot Study A pilot study will be conducted on a group of four people (one person from each group) in order to evaluate the applicability of data collection forms and treatments to be used in the study.

Blinding İsokinetic exercise (IE), Aussie current (AC), Rus current (RC), Placebo Electrical Stimulation (PES) Group,

Patients in theIE, IE + AC, IE + RC, IE +PEC groups will not be informed about the application other than exercise. The evaluations will be carried out by a physiotherapist who does not know which group the patients are in.

The physical (age, height, gender, body mass index) and socio-demographic (occupation, marital status, educational status, income-expense balance) information of the participants who will read the informed consent form and volunteer to participate in the study will be recorded. The duration of the PFPS complaint (weeks), the time elapsed since the diagnosis of PFPS (weeks), history characteristics (hypertension, diabetes mellitus and other chronic systemic diseases) will be noted. Pain intensity at rest and during performance-based functional mobility tests will be determined using the Patellofemoral Syndrome Pain Severity Scale (PSPSS). All evaluations will be done before treatment (BT), immediately after treatment, after three weeks of treatment (TA), and one month after treatment (Control).

Treatment Program The Isokinetic Exercise program will be applied to the patients as described above. Appropriate modalities will be set on the electrical stimulation device, but the device will not be operated. It will be applied for 20 minutes.

4 treatment groups will be treated five days a week, 15 sessions for three weeks. If participants miss any treatment, there will be additional treatment sessions.

By also gathering self-report measures of social anhedonia, performance on non-social and social reward valuation tasks, and measures of real-world social functioning including social network size, we aim to specify how alterations in social reward processing result in social withdrawal and functional impairment.","Impaired social functioning is a frequent and disabling sequela of trauma-related disorders. PTSD is associated with a high rate of severe impairment in quality of life relative to other anxiety disorders, including panic disorder, social phobia, and OCD, with particularly marked impairment in social quality of life. Mounting evidence indicates that impairment in quality of life in PTSD is strongly related to its effect on social functioning. Such difficulties are widespread and affect multiple social networks, including marital relationships, and friendships and family relationships. Social withdrawal, defined here in terms of reduced social network size, is of particular interest because of its strong relationship with health outcomes, including increased risk of disability, reduced immune response, and increased mortality risk; most critically, poor social integration is associated with a threefold increase in suicide risk. Because women are at a 2.3-to-3-fold increased risk compared to men of developing PTSD following trauma, understanding the differential neurobiological pathways that may contribute to the development of stress-related disorders in women is particularly critical. Women are more likely than men to endorse social detachment following trauma, especially when the trauma involves exposure to violence.

In this project, we propose abnormal reward processing (anhedonia) as a specific mechanism underlying social withdrawal in trauma-exposed women, and we present a paradigm that capitalizes on advances in neuroeconomics to elucidate the neural underpinnings of social withdrawal. Additionally, we propose to identify the possible influences of a stress peptide (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide: PACAP) implicated in sex-specific changes in social behavior following stress exposure.",['Posttraumatic Stress Disorder'],OBSERVATIONAL,"Phase 1:

221623,NCT00964561,2010-07,ESTIMATED,The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of short-term dosing of IV ciprofloxacin when administered concomitantly with IV Valortim in healthy normal human subjects.,"Valortim (MDX-1303) is a fully human monoclonal antibody (hmAb) with a high affinity for B. anthracis protective antigen (PA). Valortim is designed to target PA, which is one of three plasmid-encoded proteins that together form the toxins released by B. anthracis. Individually, these proteins (protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF)) are inactive. Toxic effects require the transport of LF and EF into the host cell, mediated by the activity of PA. Valortim binds to PA and interferes with the activity of the toxins. Based on both non-clinical and clinical data, Valortim may have utility for the pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis of individuals exposed to, or at risk of exposure to, B. anthracis and for the treatment of individuals displaying signs or symptoms of inhalational anthrax. Because the treatment of inhalational anthrax includes the use of antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones, it is necessary to demonstrate that there are no adverse interactions between newer therapeutic interventions and these medications. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin (a commonly used fluoroquinolone for both treatment and post-exposure prophylaxis of anthrax) and Valortim following co-administration, as well as the safety and tolerability of these medications when administered concomitantly.

OCD symptom severity will be assessed before treatment and 24 and 48 hours after treatment, one week after treatment, two weeks, one month, and three months after treatment. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that 0.25mg/kg of psilocybin will lead to greater symptom improvement than niacin (as the active-placebo-control agent) at the primary endpoint of 48 hours post-dosing and at all other assessment points.

Aim 2: To explore the relationship between the psilocybin-induced brain connectivity changes and symptom change in OCD. Resting-state brain connectivity will be assessed before and 48 hours after treatment. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that (i) psilocybin will normalize abnormal fronto-striatal functional connectivity in patients with OCD; and (ii) normalization of these abnormalities will correlate with improvement in symptomatology after psilocybin treatment.

This study will pilot a single-center, randomized, active-placebo-controlled, double-blind design to examine the clinical and neural effects on OCD, of either 0.25mg/kg of psilocybin or active placebo-control agent (niacin 250mg), given along with non-drug preparatory and follow-up support appointments to 30 study participants.

394498,NCT01730716,2016-11,ESTIMATED,"The study is to determine the feasibility, safety, toxicity, and maximum tolerated (safe) dose of human spinal derived neural stem cell transplantation for the treatment of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).","These stem cells are called Human Spinal Stem Cells (HSSC) and have been engineered from the spinal cord of a single fetus electively aborted after 8 weeks of gestation. The tissue was obtained with the mother's consent. The cells will be transplanted into the ALS patient's spinal cord after laminectomy, an operation that removes bone surrounding the spine. After the spinal cord is exposed, a device manufactured for this purpose will be mounted onto the patient and will hold a syringe filled with the cells. The syringe will have a needle attached and the needle will enter the spinal cord at 5-10 locations injecting the cells. The device will minimize trauma to the spinal cord by the needle by making the puncture precise and steady and injecting the material at a slow and steady speed.

ALS is a universally fatal neurodegenerative condition that causes weakness leading to paralysis and death. Life expectancy is 2-5 years. The cause is unknown and there is no effective treatment. Previous research has shown that on autopsy, ALS patients are found to have increased levels of the amino acid glutamate accumulated in the brain and spinal cord. This increase is thought to be caused by a decrease in the glutamate transporter which normally ""cleans up"" glutamate from the cells. HSSC are known to express amino acid transporters and it is hoped that this action will reduce the toxicity of accumulated glutamate and benefit ALS patients. There is a second hypothesized benefit of the HSSC and that is their ability to secrete neurotrophic support factors. Neurotrophic factors support the health of nerves.

There will be 5 sequential cohorts (Groups A - E) with 3 subjects in each cohort. New patients will be enrolled into each group. No control group is included. All subjects will receive spinal cord injections of HSSC. All subjects will also be ambulatory with respiratory function greater than or equal to 50% supine and 60% seated of predicted normal and will receive bilateral injections at the C3 through C5 cervical segments. Subjects in Group E will receive bilateral injections at the L2 through L5 lumbar segments and then return approximately one-three months later to receive bilateral injections at the C3 through C5 cervical segments.

The dose escalation plan is as follows:

1. Group A: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral C3 through C4 injections of 2x106 cells (10 injections x 2x105 cells/ injection)
2. Group B: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 4x106 cells (20 injections x 2x105 cells/ injection)
3. Group C: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 6x106 cells (20 injections x 3x105 cells/ injection)
4. Group D: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections x 4x105 cells/ injection)
5. Group E: 3 ambulatory early-stage subjects with arm weakness but not paralysis, to receive bilateral L2 through L5 injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections of 4x105 cells/ injection) and then approximately 4-12 weeks later to receive bilateral C3 through C5 injections of 8x106 cells (20 injections of 4x105 cells/ injection.

Transition from one group to the next will be determined by review of available safety data by a Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) which will occur approximately one month post surgery of the last subject in the group. The study data will be collected for 6 months post stem cell transplantation of each study subject. However, all subjects will be followed clinically until death and all SAEs and post-study data will be collected and reported. Autopsy will be strongly encouraged for evaluation of pathology and presence of transplanted cells.

The treatment consists of laminectomy or laminoplasty of approximately two to three vertebral segments overlying either L2 through L4 (for Group E only) or C3 through C5 cord segments (for all Groups) in order to allow intraspinal injections of HSSC. Each injection will administer approximately 2, 3, or 4 x 105 cells in approximately 8.5 - 10 µL volume. The subjects will receive 5 or 10 injections at approximately 4 to 5mm intervals on each side of the cord, in total 10 or 20 injections. Each injection is completed in approximately 3 minutes. The total surgical time is expected to be approximately 3 to 5 hours. After the surgery, subjects will receive routine standard of care for laminectomy subjects who undergo an intradural procedure. Prior to and after the transplant, subjects will be required to remain on immunosuppressive therapy. Immunosuppressive therapy will consist of: 1) basiliximab (Simulect®) 20mg intravenously (IV) when the dura is opened, then again at day 4 post transplantation; 2) tacrolimus (Prograf®) initially dosed at a maximum of 0.1 mg/kg divided approximately every 12 hours by mouth (po) on post transplant day 1, and then maintained at a dose that provides a trough serum level of 4 to 8 ng/ml (adjusted for IV use as necessary); and 3) mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept®) started on post transplant day 1 at 500 mg approximately every 12 hours and progressively increased over 2 weeks to 1.0 gram by mouth (po) twice a day as tolerated. Dose escalation may be modified at the discretion of the site Principal Investigator (PI). Subjects will also receive an initial bolus dose of methylprednisolone 125 mg IV approximately 2 hours prior to the first injection. Beginning on post-operative day 1, the subject will receive oral prednisone 60 mg po daily (QD) for 7 days postoperatively, then progressively decreased over the next 21 days as follows: 40 mg/day for 7 days, 20 mg/day for 7 days, then 10 mg/day for 7 days. At 28 days, prednisone will be discontinued. All pre- and post-surgery immunosuppressive drugs will be administered as noted above, at the discretion of the site PI. If these subjects have previously discontinued mycophenolate mofetil and/or tacrolimus, they may be re-challenged as per the dosing described above, at the discretion of the site PI.

The decision to continue immunosuppression therapy will be at the discretion of the site PIs. Mycophenolate mofetil may be dosed down to half or discontinued prior to the end of the study period if the subject experiences adverse reactions to the immunosuppressive agents. If adverse reactions still persist, tacrolimus dose can be further reduced in half and then further considered to be discontinued. Any or all of the immunosuppressive agents may be reduced or stopped at the discretion of the site PI if it is suspected or determined that the immunosuppressive agent is the cause of toxicity and if symptoms of toxicity cannot be managed adequately with symptomatic treatment.

The study will proceed successively from Group A to Group E with a 4-week interval between Groups. The Safety Monitoring Board (SMB) will be convened at the end of the 4-week interval and review all available safety data. Based on the safety outcomes from the 3 subjects in each Group, the SMB will recommend, according to a predetermined rule, whether to enroll 3 new subjects into the next Group, to continue to collect additional information from the same Group, to enroll additional subjects into the same Group, or to suspend the study. Potential subjects will be recruited for the study but put on a waiting list until SMB approval of their treatment. The SMB will consist of 3 neurologists with expertise in ALS, 1 spinal neurosurgeon, 1 neurooncologist, 1 transplant immunologist, and the scientific director of the ALS Association.

Subjects will be assessed for adverse events including pain and infection, motor function, and quality of life. Additional assessments will be made to measure any postoperative changes from baseline in neurologic deficits, imaging studies, bladder or bowel function, allodynia, and neuropathic pain (see schedule of activities). Subjects will also undergo serial assessments of respiratory function (vital capacity (VC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF)), motor function (Ashworth Spasticity Scale, hand-held dynamometry and electrical impedance myography (EIM)), and respiratory function (diaphragm ultrasound). All subjects will undergo cardiac autonomic function testing at Day -14 to Day -2 pre-operatively, and at 1 and 3 months post-operatively to monitor for potential cardiac autonomic neuropathy.

There will be a lead-in period of at least 1 month period of clinical evaluations before surgery to estimate the slope of decline of clinical status. Measures during this lead-in time will be the ALSFRS-R, hand-held dynamometry/grip strength, Ashworth Spasticity Scale, VC and NIF, EIM, and diaphragm ultrasound.Subjects will be followed postoperatively at 2 and 4 weeks, and then at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months, and then at every 6 months thereafter until death.",['Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

PTB is associated with increased risk of poor short and long-term neonatal outcomes. PTB can occur in multiple clinical scenarios including spontaneous PTB (e.g. preterm labor, preterm pre-labor rupture of membranes) and medically induced preterm labor (e.g. preeclampsia). Women with a history of PTB are at 1.5 - 2 fold increased risk for future PTB. There are medical therapies than can reduce the risk of recurrent PTB specific to the presumed etiology of the prior PTB. Thus, women with a history of a prior PTB who receive care with Duke Maternal Fetal Medicine (MFM) receive and Individualized Prematurity Prevention Plan (IP3) to reduce their risk of recurrent PTB. The IP3 plans are often labor intensive with requirements ranging from daily medications, weekly clinic visits, painful injections or invasive ultrasounds.

Given the increased rate so of PTB among NHB women and some suggestion of decreased adherence in this population1, we previously conducted qualitative studies with NHB women to uncover patient perceived barriers to IP3 adherence2,3. These studies revealed that NHB women with prior preterm birth felt that stress and lack of support were key barriers to preterm birth prevention adherence. Stress and limited support made women feel isolated from their peers and community. Based on these data we worked with a stakeholder group to develop a patient-centered, community-involved intervention that will increased adherence to an individualized prematurity prevention plan using community-level social supports. The resulting invention titled, EngagINg the COmmunity to Reduce Preterm Birth via Adherence To an Individualized Prematurity Prevention Plan (INCORPorATe IP3) includes community doula led group social support.",['Preterm Birth'],INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

326810,NCT05151029,2023-10-01,ESTIMATED,2.2 Aim(s) of the Research (50 words max): To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of Sonoelastography in the evaluation of major salivary gland lesions using histopathology as gold standard.,"Salivary gland diseases are ranging from the minor inflammatory conditions to a group of benign and malignant neoplasms. Most of the salivary gland disorders manifest themselves as the enlargement of the gland which may be associated with pain or swelling. Physical examination together with laboratory analyses may not be sufficient to discriminate these diseases . Therefore, an accurate, non invasive diagnostic method is needed to discriminate these diseases (1).

Although ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is considered the gold standard for preoperative diagnosis (2), it is an invasive method requiring significant experience to avoid complications like injury of the facial nerve as it courses within the parotid gland. This explains the continuing desire for further non-invasive diagnostic options (3).

The current imaging modalities are ultrasonography, Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Despite being highly sensitive, they lack the accuracy in differentiating benign and malignant lesions because of considerable overlap between the imaging features of benign and malignant salivary gland lesions.

Sonoelastography is a new technique that depends on the elastic properties of soft tissues, with the idea of malignant lesions being stiffer than benign or normal tissue. It may have a dependable role in diagnosing different salivary gland diseases, the same way it has been used in different parts of the body, such as the breast, lymph nodes, and thyroid (4). To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies concerning the role of elastography in the field of salivary gland disease.",['Salivary Gland Diseases'],OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria

The patients will be randomized to treatment with the biologic drug, Mepolizumab, or the biologic drug Mepolizumab combined with Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of combined treatment with biologic treatment and surgery vs. biologic treatment only.

The hypothesis is that surgical removal of polyps and inflamed tissue from the nasal sinuses will increase the effect of the biologic treatment, leading to a lower disease burden after 6 months of treatment, compared with biologic drugs only. Furthermore, combined biologics and surgery will keep a lower disease burden and better general health after 12 months of treatment than biologics alone.

The investigators will also examine the effect of TBS on craving for cigarettes as well as opioids. Participants will perform a stress induction procedure that mirrors an optimum combination of cues that trigger tonic craving in their environment while exposed to stress. All four sessions of TBS/sham TMS will be performed on the same day, with each session lasting for approximately 10 minutes and separated by 50 minute intervals.","Tobacco use disorder (TUD) is highly comorbid with opioid use disorder (OUD). Craving in TUD as well as OUD is of two kinds - phasic and tonic. Phasic craving is present at baseline and tonic craving is accentuated by environmental stimuli. A predominant mediator of tonic craving is attentional bias (AB) for environmental stimuli related to either smoking or opioid use.

The study is comprised of two days of participation. On the first day, participants will perform two attentional bias (AB) paradigms - one to assess their baseline AB for smoking cues versus neutral cues and another AB paradigm to assess baseline AB for opioid cues versus neutral cues. Craving will be assessed using tobacco craving questionnaire and a visual analogue scale (for opioids), in the context of participants performing a stress induction procedure (which will be a combination of the cold pressor test and PASAT). The investigators will also acquire a baseline resting state fMRI in addition to MRPAGE structural T1 and T2W sequences.

On the second day, participants will receive either four sessions of TBS or sham TMS. Targeting will be down using processed resting state brain scan. Each session of TBS or sham TMS will last approximately 10 minutes. During each of the 50 minute intervals between stimulation sessions, participants will perform AB paradigms for smoking and opioids. The craving scale with stress induction will be performed twice - once before the sessions and once after the four sessions of TBS/sham TMS.

6357,NCT05300802,2022-07-16,ACTUAL,"Congenital Heart Diseases (CHD) are one of the most common congenital anomalies. Worldwide, 8 to 9 out of 1000 of children are born with a CHD, of which 25 percent of are cyanotic CHD. In Indonesia, the prevalence is 43.200 out of 4.8 million births annually. The morbidity and mortality of cyanotic CHDs in the National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita (NCCHK) are higher than acyanotic CHDs. Open-heart surgery using a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) machine temporarily takes over the function of the heart and lung during surgery. However, the use of CPB has several negative effects such myocardial injury, systemic inflammation, and reperfusion injury. Preoperative hypoxia in cyanotic CHD tends to be associated with a higher risk of myocardial injury. Myocardial protection has an important role in attenuating those effects. Generally, we use a cardioplegia solution as myocardial protection, but there are several non-cardioplegia techniques that can be used to enhance myocardial protection during cardiac bypass, such as adding an anesthetic agent. Dexmedetomidine (DEX) is the active dextroisomer of medetomidine, a selective α-2 adrenergic, which has major effects including hypnosis, sedation, and analgesia as well as cardiovascular effects. The sedation is induced by stimulating the α-2 adrenergic receptor in the locus coeruleus (LC) in the pons cerebri. DEX also increases the level of GABA and Galanin and reduces endogenous norepinephrine. The lower level of endogenous norepinephrine decreases the afterload of the ventricles, increases cardiac output, and reduces myocardial injury as a result. Furthermore, the peripheral effects of DEX can reduce myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (MIR) by inhibiting NF-кB pathway activation and reducing the number of proinflammatory cytokines released. Research related to the priming and infusion of DEX during CPB in patients with cyanotic CHDs who are undergoing open-heart surgery is less reported. The aims of this study are to determine the effectiveness of the priming and infusion of DEX during CPB as myocardial protection by using two different doses compared to the control group. The population included in this study is pediatric patients with cyanotic CHD who are undergoing open-heart surgery using CPB and who classified as 6 to 9 in the Aristotle Score.","The investigators will conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial preliminary study to determine the effectiveness of the priming and infusion of DEX during CPB as myocardial protection by using two different doses compared to the control group.

Several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of IBS, including psychological stress, gastrointestinal motility, and diet . More recently, it has become clear that the gastrointestinal microbiota may play a critical role in the pathophysiology of this functional GI condition.

Several studies have shown that an altered gut microbiota profile is present in at least some subgroups of IBS patients. This may, in part, explain why a proportion of IBS patients have elevated levels of inflammatory mediators in systemic circulation.

Gut microbiome manipulation, for example through the use of probiotic and prebiotic supplements, has shown some promise in the treatment of IBS. However, the research in this area is still in its infancy, and it remains unclear what type of intervention that is the preferred choice in cases of IBS.

285358,NCT06551155,2026-08-05,ESTIMATED,"Osteoporosis (OP) is one of most common age-associated and chronic metabolic bone diseases, featured by a decrease of bone mineral density (BMD) that increases the risk of bone fractures.OP guidelines agree that Dual-X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) is the gold standard for BMD assessment, but for the different OP stages screening and diagnosis, BMD by itself is not an accurate predictor. Thus, OP is often misdiagnosed. Aim of the this study is to improve a tool for OP diagnosis based on the ability of circulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) to maintain or not their in vitro viability (IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli European patent n.3008470 March 21, 2018) for the measurement of the different OP severity levels, also considering specific gender related differences.","Inadequate assessment, diagnosis, and stratification of patients with bone mass loss can lead to an increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. Therefore, alternative and advanced methods to support screening and diagnosis of osteoporosis (OP) are becoming increasingly essential, particularly considering specific gender differences. In this context, evaluating new methods and innovative techniques is a global challenge. To address this challenge, in 2018, the IRCCS Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli (IOR) filed a European patent (European Patent No. 3008470, March 21, 2018; Inventors: Fini M, Giardino R, Salamanna F) related to an in vitro method for correlating the vitality of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with bone metabolism alterations and OP through simple optical microscope observation. Additionally, specific gender-related differences have been observed in the number, size, differentiation time, and gene and protein expression profiles of PBMCs from osteoporotic patients of different sexes. In this context, the purpose of this study is to fully expand and develop the patent filed by IRCCS IOR in 2018 in order to: a) improve the understanding of the mechanisms of action and observed behavior in PBMCs on which the IOR patent is based; b) correlate the in vitro behavior of PBMCs with different levels of bone metabolism alteration (from osteopenia to fragility fractures); c) evaluate the correlation between the Dual-X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) T-score and other blood factors related to OP (parameters related to platelets, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, lymphocyte subpopulations) with the in vitro behavior of PBMCs in the presence of different levels of bone metabolism alteration, considering specific gender differences.","['Osteoporosis, Osteopenia', 'Osteoporosis Fracture']",OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

Dysautonomia refers to the abnormal function of the autonomic nervous system including sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system. Diabetes mellitus causes secondary dysautonomias (1). The Survey of Autonomic Symptoms (SAS) is a simple and validated tool to assess the presence and severity of autonomic symptoms (2).

Diabetic patients also suffer from chronic neuropathic pain. After amputation surgeries, up to 78% of these patients may develop post surgical neuropathic pain (3). The self-report version of the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs pain scale (S-LANSS) is validated as a diagnostic tool to assess patients with neuropathic pain (4). This scale will be used to assess if there is any changes in the pain experienced after diabetic foot surgery.

Currently, both spinal anaesthesia (SAB) and ultrasound guided femoral and sciatic peripheral nerve blocks (FSNB) are acceptable anaesthesia for dysautonomic diabetic patients with diabetic foot ulcer going for wound debridement, Ray's amputation and below knee amputation (5)

Many studies have compared multiple perioperative parameters of patients undergoing lower limb surgery under peripheral nerve blocks versus spinal anaesthesia. These parameters include preparation time, anaesthetic complications (e.g. hypotension, nausea and vomiting, post-dural puncture headache, urinary retention), patient satisfaction and postoperative pain control (6,7,8).

The investigators want to study if patients with dysautonomia have a different haemodynamic response to spinal anaesthesia or peripheral nerve blockade changes compared to patients with normal autonomic function.

211843,NCT05694871,2027-05-31,ESTIMATED,"This phase II trial compares the effect of treatment with palbociclib alone to treatment with palbociclib plus cemiplimab for treating patients with dedifferentiated liposarcoma that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced). Palbociclib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Cemiplimab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. The combination of these two drugs may be more effective in shrinking or stabilizing advanced dedifferentiated liposarcoma compared to palbociclib alone.","PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To perform a safety lead-in among 6 patients to confirm that the combination of palbociclib and cemiplimab is safe and tolerable.

II. To evaluate whether palbociclib in combination with cemiplimab (Arm 2) demonstrates a superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to palbociclib monotherapy (Arm 1) for patients with advanced dedifferentiated liposarcoma (DDLPS).

SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

I. To evaluate the toxicity profile in and across each treatment arm as determined by both Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) and Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO)-CTCAE criteria.

II. To evaluate and compare the objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) in and across each treatment arm.

III. To evaluate and compare the overall survival (OS) in and across each treatment arm.

IV. To evaluate and compare progression-free rate at 8 weeks (PFR8) in and across each treatment arm.

EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

I. To collect genomic sequencing data previously collected as standard of care, including data on CDK4 copy number (as determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization \[FISH\] or other molecular testing).

II. To conduct multiplex immunohistochemistry using archival tumor tissue (where available) to define densities of infiltrating immune cell subsets and tumor and immune cell major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and PD-L1 expression.

III. To perform an exploratory analysis to evaluate for any relationship between CDK4 copy number and (a) the tumor immune microenvironment as defined by multiplex immunohistochemistry and (b) clinical outcomes from study treatment.

IV. To explore efficacy and toxicity endpoints, including PFS and ORR, for patients who progress on palbociclib monotherapy and crossover to the palbociclib plus cemiplimab combination.

OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

ARM I: Patients receive palbociclib orally (PO) on study. Patients will be allowed to cross over to Arm II following documentation of disease progression. Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans throughout the trial. Patients may also undergo blood sample collection on study.

ARM II: Patients receive palbociclib PO and cemiplimab intravenously (IV) on study. Patients undergo MRI or CT scans throughout the trial. Patients may also undergo blood sample collection on study.","['Advanced Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma', 'Locally Advanced Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma', 'Metastatic Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma', 'Stage III Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Trunk and Extremities AJCC v8', 'Stage IV Soft Tissue Sarcoma of the Trunk and Extremities AJCC v8', 'Unresectable Dedifferentiated Liposarcoma']",INTERVENTIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

The most common form of ILD, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), is associated with poor survival, and high symptom burden and poor quality of life as the disease progresses.

ILD represents an increasing proportion of patients with chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure.

Despite this poor prognosis, palliative care remains underused in patients with ILD. This may be due to under-recognition of the palliative care needs and symptom burden, or unfamiliarity and discomfort with palliative therapies.

Though oncology has largely embraced earlier integration of palliative care, which has translated into improvements in end-of-life (EOL) care for patients with lung cancer,palliative and EOL care for non-malignant diseases are now gaining increased attention.

In pulmonary disease, this research has mainly focused on COPD and demonstrated a significant burden of unmet palliative care needs and lower quality of EOL care compared with patients with cancer. Similar attention is only beginning to be paid to ILD, but symptom burden and quality of EOL care in patients with ILD have yet to be quantified, and furthermore none has so far investigated the possible role of palliative care in these patients.

The investigators will examine with the present study the effect of introducing palliative in patients with end-stage idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, refractory to the pharmacological treatment or not deemed to be treated, on patient-reported outcomes and end-of-life care.

223277,NCT01006083,2012-02,ESTIMATED,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of antiplatelet (APA)therapy continuation in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery (laminectomy, discectomy and foraminotomy), and to gather evidence-based data regarding postoperative outcomes potentially related to APA management.","BACKGROUND Antiplatelet agents (APAs) are widely prescribed for coronary stenting, primary and secondary prevention of cerebrovascular and coronary artery disease. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin/plavix) has become the mainstay antiplatelet treatment strategy for the prevention of stent thrombosis. Maintaining antiplatelet therapy until the end of the indicated period is crucial for the success of coronary stents. Premature discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy markedly increases the risk of stent thrombosis, a catastrophic event that frequently leads to myocardial infarction (MI), with a death rate of 20-40%. Aspirin is commonly prescribed for lifetime in patients at increased atherothrombotic risk, whereas Plavix is regarded as mandatory until the coronary stents are fully endothelialized, which takes 4-6 weeks for bare metal stents and up to 1 yr for drug-eluting stents. And yet, within the first year after stenting, approximately 5% of patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) will require noncardiac surgery, thus raising dilemmas of APA management: stopping APA treatment before operation to avoid bleeding while risking postoperative stent thrombosis versus maintaining APA therapy perioperatively thus risking extensive blood loss but limiting the risks of postoperative ischemic events.

Current recommendations are that aspirin should not be discontinued pre-operatively, with the exception of brain surgery and certain urological operations in which bleeding may be difficult to control and is therefore life threatening.

The continued use of plavix during the perioperative period significantly increases intraoperative blood loss, re-operations for the control of hemorrhage and transfusions, but does not affect morbidity, mortality, or surgical outcomes.

Most guidelines recommend to postpone invasive procedures until the end of the indication for plavix. Only vital or emergency surgery should be performed on full antiplatelet therapy, with the exception of procedures in which even a small hemorrhage may have disastrous consequences (e.g. intracranial surgery, spinal surgery in the medullary canal, surgery of the posterior chamber of the eye), or procedures involving massive bleeding.

Evidence-based data are needed to guide management of patients in whom early antiplatelet withdrawal is being considered (e.g. those who require non-cardiac surgery). Several studies have been conducted in orthopedic and cardiac surgery, however, to the best of our knowledge, not in spine surgery. This type of surgery might often be semi-urgent and postponing surgery for long time may be problematic.

This prospective, observational study is designed to evaluate the safety of APA therapy continuation in patients admitted for lumbar spine surgery.

METHODS

Study design The study will be conducted as an observational one. An informed consent will be obtained from all patients matching the above criteria. Diuretics and oral hypoglycemics will be discontinued the day prior to surgery, as dictated by the routines in our patients. Antiplatelet therapy will be continued as commonly practiced in these procedures. Any deviation from this protocol will be documented. Throughout the postoperative period study patients will be observed for any bleeding- or thrombosis-related events, and relevant perioperative data will documented (see ""patient monitoring \& assessment"").

Peri-operative management Anesthetic and surgical management, including management of surgical hemorrhage or any other hemodynamic event will adhere to standard practice. Postoperatively, study patients will be transferred to the post-anesthesia care unit and later to the neurosurgery department, unless otherwise indicated. In the postoperative period, departmental routines will guide blood product transfusions, pain management, fluid regimens and medications administered.

Patient monitoring \& assessment

Patients will be allocated into 4 groups:

1. Patients not at risk of coronary and/or cerebrovascular disease, and not taking APAs.
2. Patients at high risk for cardio/cerebrovascular disease (diabetes mellitus, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, morbid obesity), but not taking APAs.
3. High-risk patients with cardiovascular risk factors (as above), in whom APA is prescribed as primary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD).
4. Patients with a history of a coronary syndrome (stable/unstable angina); MI; transient ischemic attack (TIA)/stroke; severe carotid artery stenosis/stenting; or peripheral vascular disease, on APAs for secondary prevention.

For each consented patient included in the study we will record demographics and medical history ; chronic medications ; detailed cardiovascular history ; neurological examination ; APA-related data: type and dose of APA taken; indication ; Intra-operative data ; and perioperative complications.

Outcome measures

1. Primary outcomes: hemorrhagic, thrombotic, and neurological complications Include any complication, morbidity or death potentially caused by continuation (e.g., direct or indirect hemorrhage; hemorrhagic CVA) or withdrawal of APA therapy (e.g., MI; PE; ischemic CVA; DVT; etc.), occurring until discharge, or within 30 postoperative days. Neurological complications may be related to surgery; bleeding; thrombosis; other, and will be classified accordingly.
2. Secondary outcomes Include: re-intubations; transfer to ICU; length of stay (LOS); re-admissions within 7 / 30 days; major morbidity or death 30 and 60 days postoperatively.

Study size The study is expected to last 2 years, and to include approximately 200 patients.

The sample size was 66. The subjects were divided in two groups, 33 subjects in Bowen's Technique group and 33 subjects in Myofascial Release Technique group. Study duration was of 6 months. Sampling technique applied was non probability purposive sampling technique. The patients aged 20-40 years and clinicaly diagnosed with Trapezitis(spasm,trigger points,tenderness,stiffness) were included in the study. Tools used in the study are Cervical ROMs, NPRS, NDI, Isometric Scapular Pinch Test and Lateral Scapular Slide Test.","Trapezitis is a condition that involves inflammation of the trapezius muscle. The upper fibers of trapezius, being the postural muscles, are highly susceptible to overuse injuries and thus the inflammation.This results in pain that is present during the rest, is aggravated with activity and is referred to the other areas. The pain results in protective spasm of the antagonistic muscle group that also restricts the passive range of motion and makes it painful too. In people working for long hours at a desk and computers or spending many hours driving, the low level of upper trapezius activity is frequently found because of head posture during sitting and standing , which is common cause of tension and neck pain in such people.Various recent studies have hypothesized that trapezitis occurs due to muscle tissue overloading and injury, that results in involuntary shortening of localized muscle fibers. The stressed soft tissue area thus receives less glucose, oxygen and nutrients supply; subsequently high levels of metabolic waste products are accumulated. And this cascade of events ends in altered status of tissue, pain and the development of the Trigger points in the muscle.

Myofascial Release(MFR) is a soft tissue mobilization technique that is defined as "" the facilitation of mechanical, neural and psycho physiological adaptive potential as interfaced via the myofascial system"".MFR decreases the pain and restores the proper alignment by changing the ground substance's viscosity to more fluid state resulting in elimination of excessive pressure of fascia on the pain sensitive structures.

There is one more soft tissue technique called 'Bowen Technique' that is useful and indicated in myofascial pain. The Bowen technique is defined as:

'...dynamic system of muscle and connective tissue therapy which balances the body to allow it to heal itself. The work consists of a series of precise moves on specific points of the body. These moves are light and can be done through clothing. There are frequent and important pauses between each series of moves giving the body time to benefit from each. The technique uses positive moves that initiate a positive energy flow and negative moves that isolate this energy to a specific area' (Rentsch and Rentsch,1997) The Bowen technique was developed by late Tom Bowen in Geelong, Australia in 1950. It is a connective tissue technique that uses subtle inputs called 'Bowen moves' to the body that stimulates the body's self-healing. The Bowen moves applied are in several sets in a complete session of 15-45 minutes duration. While applying the technique, the therapist uses the thumb when the Bowen move is executed away from the patient's body and two fingers are used when the Bowen move is executed towards the patient's body. The technique can be used anywhere on the origin, insertion or the belly of the muscle and produces a physical and an energetic action.

This technique can be used to treat many types acute and chronic injuries and other health issues. It does this by using holistic approach in which body's innate healing mechanism is stimulated. This technique has been recommended in many conditions like headache, cervical pain, back pain, whiplash injury, TMJ dysfunction, herniated disk, tennis elbow, hamstring tightness and frozen shoulder, work related injuries etc.

An RCT was done by Ekta S. Chaudhary, Nehal Shah, Neeta Vyas, Ratan Khuman1, Dhara Chavda1, Gopal Nambi that compared the effectiveness of MFR and cold pack in Upper trapezius Spasm and concluded both MFR and cold pack along with exercises to be effective in upper trapezium muscle spasm but the overall effects of MFR surpassed the cold therapy. Another study by Pooja Mane , Amrutkuvar Pawar , Trupti Warude compared the effects of Myofascial Release technique with Deep Friction Massage on pain and cervical ROM, the results concluded both therapies to bring improvement in pain and cervical ROM but MFR was more effective. Similarly, a systematic review of RCTs was conducted to determine the effectiveness of MFR in decreasing pain , improving function and elongate length and concluded MFR to be emerging strategy with strong evidence base and solid treatment option for many conditions. A study was conducted to compare the effects of MFR with hot pack in reducing pain and improving passive ROM in shoulder joint and that concluded both to be effective but MFR proved to be more favorable because of the less time spent and no need of equipment.

A study has been done to see the effects of Bowen technique as an adjunct therapy to conventional physiotherapy treatment on the pain and functional outcomes in patient with Acute trapezitis and the results established Bowen technique to be effective in decreasing pain and improving functional outcomes in Acute trapezitis.A few studies were conducted that evaluated the effectiveness of Bowen technique in frozen shoulder and concluded this technique as a positive intervention in improving mobility, functional status and decreasing pain. A few studies were conducted that compared the effects of Bowen technique vs MET in treatment of hamstring tightness.And few other worked to establish the effectiveness of Bowen technique in different complex and common conditions and found positive results.A study was done to show Bowen technique to be effective in health service workplace to improve physical as well as mental well-being of the working staff.

This study aims to compare the short term effects of Bowen Technique and MFR on pain and neck disability in patients with trapezitis. Also it intends to study the short term effects of both techniques on scapular motions. Bowen technique is a relatively new technique, having easier application and has been less worked on. So, if this study proves the effectiveness of Bowen technique in comparison with MFR in patient with trapezitis. Further studies can be conducted to evaluate its efficacy as an independent and preferable procedure in treatment of other conditions and further work can be conducted on other areas as well.

Excessive perioperative bleeding requiring massive transfusion of allogeneic blood products, and surgical reexploration remain major challenges in these patients. Previous research has indicated that patients with AAD show pronounced haemostatic alterations prior to surgery which are aggravated during major aortic surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass and hypothermia full heparinization.

Intensified anticoagulation management guided by heparin dose response (HDR) calculation, and repeated measurement of heparin concentration may be more effective than standard empiric weight-based heparin and protamine management monitored by activated clotting time (ACT) measurements to suppress thrombin generation during surgery for AAD.

This randomized controlled clinical trial compares the impact of two recommended anticoagulation management strategies during surgery for AAD including deep hypothermia on activation of coagulation: Heparin/protamine-management based on HDR-titration by means of HMS Plus® versus current institutional standard (HDR- versus ACT-approach).

Primary endpoint is thrombin generation as measured by early postoperative prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2). Secondary endpoints are other markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis as well as clinical outcome.","Hypotheses:

Primary: HDR-approach is superior to ACT-approach in terms of suppressing thrombin generation after emergent surgery for acute aortic dissection (Stanford type A).

Previous studies have shown that TyG index is associated with carotid atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification and high risk of CVD.

This study aims to predict severity of CAD using TyG index and its correlation to coronary angiography findings.","Coronary artery disease (CAD) is characterized by vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which causes coronary stenosis and myocardial ischemia. The blockage of the blood vessel caused by the detachment of the endovascular plate leads to an acute CAD attack. Without timely intervention, this can be life-threatening for the patient. Currently, coronary angiography (CAG) is the reference standard for diagnosing CAD with inconclusive evidence to confirm the morbid state. Although it assesses the severity of coronary vascular occlusion, this technique is invasive and carries inherent risks.

Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) is a common dyslipidemia and the association of triglyceride (TG) with CVD risk remains controversial . However, judging from a credible body of evidence, we can conclude that HTG is an independent risk factor of developing glucose metabolism disorders. Plasma TG levels are strongly associated with raised glucose levels because of the interactions between fat, muscle and function of pancreatic β-cells .

Moreover, accumulation of TG in the liver may cause fatty liver disease, which can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) . Prospective studies have revealed that plasma TG is an independent risk factor for developing T2DM . Additionally, it has been demonstrated that lowering TG, such as fibrates do, can significantly attenuate the process of developing insulin resistance . Furthermore, it also has been reported that both fasting glucose and TG within the high normal range may predict CVD risk . Hence, evaluating the joint value of TG and fasting glucose in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) may be clinically in need.

Triglyceride glucose (TyG) index is a novel marker, which has been demonstrated to have a high sensitivity and specificity in identifying metabolic syndrome . Previous studies have shown that TyG index is associated with carotid atherosclerosis, coronary artery calcification and high risk of CVD.

Several studies demonstrated that the TyG index has a positive relevance with type 2 diabetes, Insulin resistence ,subclinical myocardial injury,and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). A higher TyG index correlates with a greater incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes and ACS, indicating its potential as an independent predictor for cardiovascular disease prognosis.

A recent large-scale prospective study suggested that the TyG index is an independent predictor for the progression of coronary artery calcification, especially in individuals without heavy coronary artery calcification at baseline . Moreover, an increased TyG index has been shown to be independently associated with higher risks of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, including myocardial infarction, and worse prognosis in patients with ACS, irrespective of diabetes mellitus .

This study aims to predict severity of CAD using TyG index and its correlation to coronary angiography findings.",['Coronary Artery Disease'],OBSERVATIONAL,"Inclusion Criteria:

This study includes a longitudinal observation study of patients who enter the general ward (admission) until they leave the hospital (discharge).

This study includes standard patient care by the hospital staff with addition of Myotrace measurement, accelerometry and respiratory rate measurement via respiration belt during the NRD measurement.

The primary endpoint of the study is the Neural Respiratory Drive (NRD) index. This index will offline be compared to the specialist in thoracic medicine's assessment of the patient's health status after study closure. The General Ward care team will be blinded to the index values during the study. Re-admission information (i.e. 14 days after discharge) will be collected as well and used in the comparison with NRD index and specialist in thoracic medicine evaluation. Furthermore, the site will be asked to make note of patient events during study participation that are important for the study and study measurements.
